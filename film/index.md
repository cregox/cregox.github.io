<small>very [proud](/proud) of being the other half making this *damme* thing (haha). we did it in less than a week!</small>

<small>no effort done on walking down the stairs here, unlike one may be led to believe due to superb acting, back in 2007. pure talent!</small>

# the difference between [an amateur](/tv) and a professional

there's the obvious "getting big financial returns".

and there's the **body** of work.

either by quantity or quality.

a single recognizable piece of art can be worth more than a thousand of films of any size (contrary to the belief of an image worthing for a thousand words).

and dozens of nice shorts will raise the bar higher than one or two meaningless videos (like the ones in this page).

despite the appearences, we are always shooting to the stars.

and, being unable to aim for a large amount of production, there's this peculiar and pesky detail oriented thing that shall, *someday* lead to something [quite unique](/random). even [exquisite](/formigas), if you will.

**someday!**
