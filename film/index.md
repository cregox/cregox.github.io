wait, what? is cregox also a film maker?

he wished. the potential is certainly there:

<small>very [proud](/proud) of being the other half making this. we did it in less than a week!</small>

<small>no effort done here, back in 2007. still, it shows some promise.</small>

but what's the difference between [an amateur](/tv) and a professional?

other than the obvious "getting big financial returns", there's the **body** of work. either by quantity or quality.

a single recognizable piece can be worth more than a thousand of films of any size.

and dozens of nice shorts will raise the bar higher than one or two meaningless videos (like the ones in this page).

we are always shooting to the stars and, being unable to aim for a large amount of production, there's this peculiar and pesky detail oriented thing that shall, *someday* lead to something [unique](/random).

someday!
