# wait, what? is cregox [also](/casting) a filmmaker?

he wished. the potential is certainly there:


{% include youtube.html id='H3dYs97krpc' ratio='56.25%' %}
<small>first video produced mostly alone and edited on a cell phone... such a long story.</small>

{% include youtube.html id='fxMaeJjY4jk' ratio='56.25%' %}
<small>very [proud](/proud) of being the other half making this *damme* thing (haha). we did it in less than a week!</small>

{% include youtube.html id='x1rP7zmmTX0' ratio='56.25%' %}
<small>no effort done on walking down the stairs here, unlike one may be led to believe due to superb acting, back in 2007. pure talent!</small>

# the difference between [an amateur](/tv) and a professional

there's the obvious "getting big financial returns".

and there's the **body** of work.

either by quantity or quality.

a single recognizable piece of art can be worth more than a thousand of films of any size (contrary to the belief of an image worthing for a thousand words).

and dozens of nice shorts will raise the bar higher than one or two meaningless videos (like the ones on this page).

always shoot to the stars!

do something [unique](/random). even [exquisite](/formigas), if you will.

**keep living.**
