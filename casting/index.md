# greetings!

and welcome to my acting and [producing](/film) related projects page.

![myself in finland, photo by @guzforster](cregox_finland_(by_guz).jpg)

starting july 2014 i was a brief member/student in [ETA]({{ site.a.eta }}). completed the first module during 3 months. it's a theater course free of fees (with the cheapest rates ever!). most of their income comes from students plays, starting from the very 1st module. we learn right there and then, raw with no experience, how to hunt for money as artists/producers and do everything except directing, lightning and sound, which comes from the great teachers and former students.

cregox is also a fine amateur actor, still with lots to learn and very little to show as an artist - <small>if you want to start **digging** him/me up online, however... boy, as a web freak i've created small "artistic" little pieces, such as [this old thing]({{ site.a.cregox.wiki.game }}) (which is now broken and I don't recall [what was it]({{ site.a.cregox.wiki.old.user }}) but it sure was a form of art!). for a terrible instance, [my mom]({{ site.a.cregox.quora.sandra }}) surely loves every little thing i do over all of her 4 kids. i believe it has to do with "[my artistic side]({{ site.a.cregox.github.wiki.novel }})" which me, her and some close friends can truly appreciate.</small>

# media

- [youtube]({{ site.a.youtube }}) have some weak videos i've made, might be worth it as a fringe reference.
- [casting]({{ site.a.caue.casting }}) is a more traditional (and boring) "casting" style if you're into this crap.
- should use more [instagram]({{ site.a.instagram }})? probably not. :)
- [random fun](/random), [why not](/talk/t/focus-on-mario-forget-the-rest-of-universe/7919)? randomness resonates a lot with me, i'd say.
- back to [myself](/myself) then, with more actual real photos.

# somewhat relevant projects

- [Abaixa Tampa (Lower the toilet lid)]({{ site.a.abaixatampa }}), the theater play in portuguese made with ETA.
- [Funny or Die with Jean Claude]({{ site.a.damme }}), *cool* video made in 5 days from march 2014, with my first and worst acting ever.

# "poetry" (or some sort of art in form of text)

- [talk.cregox.net](/talk) a ["ghost town"](/talk/t/a-beginning-for-the-forums-here/7#7) I've made and home to most of my [blog](/blog) as an [inform**art**icist](/talk/t/to-kstanley-can-a-neat-mario-start-up-a-basiux/7914) and [progammer*](/talk/t/yeah-im-also-a-progammer/7676)
