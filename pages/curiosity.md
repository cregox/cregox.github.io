for now, just a link to my favourite topics [there](https://curiosity.com/4577272747245185158/likes/topics/).

also, keep in mind that science should also always be [fun](/tv)!

even if it often gets [too serious or out of track](/tamera). or, even ["worse"](/language), [too utopian](https://ncase.me/ballot)... it's probably better to [stick with fun](https://ncase.me/fireflies). ðŸ˜˜
