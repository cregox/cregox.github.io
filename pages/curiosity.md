this used to have a link to my favourite topics [there (broken link)](https://curiosity.com/4577272747245185158/likes/topics/).

curiosity.com is now just a regular podcast which could never capture my interest. i still prefer [[freakonomics](/freakonomics)] when i can listen to any pods.

but it was, for a few brief months (i think less than 2 years), the best news source ever. i never saw anything this good before or after. i never paid for any news before or after.

it was just great science curation, and 2 to 5 minutes read, very well structured. 5 articles per day selection. average 1.5 that i could always find interest in reading.

wished i could get some hands in their archive and put everything back on (except i would take off all the [advertising, obviously](/ads)).

also, science should also always be [fun](/tv)! and they kinda had hit a sweet spot even on this aspect.

(even if it often gets [too serious or out of track](/tamera). or, even ["worse"](/language), [too utopian](https://ncase.me/ballot)... it's probably better to [stick with fun](https://ncase.me/fireflies))

sigh. ðŸ¥º
