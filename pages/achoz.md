[[ahoxus](/ahoxus)] helps you to reduce all your money needs down to zero.

**achoz**, by ahoxus, is a simple and [[free/libre](/free)] open source solution to integrate everything for all your digital needs.

# talk

using [[emails](/emails)] we can replace all your [[facebook](/facebook)] and other such needs:

- identity: freenom for free nameserver

- [[forums](/forums)]: a mailing list using sourcehut
- messengers: with [[delta chat](/delta chat)] and jitsi (plus telegram and voip while no ringing)

- irc: much better with forums and messengers

# data

- files: nextcloud and syncthing

- music: any radio app? TK
- videos: magict? plus lbry? TK

# money

- ledger: need something better than budget bakers wallet TK
- bank: bitcoin, of course... good to have money, even without any need for it!

# search

this is the most complex, yet, once everything else is set, it's also the simplest one to resolve!
