![wiki wiki]({{ page.image }})

for a big tk...

this was created after the [[OSS note](/oss)] about what i [[really](/reality)] mean when i just started using those brackets to signalise internal links to important definitions in the wikipedia style. but this is not exactly a wiki page (yet, because it's much harder to do) my will is to make them of a different colour from most links in this website, which might work as a better signalling of what they mean.

a constant effort to improve on our current human written communication protocols.

also, why not, a brief history and context of what wikipedia means to me. which needs further research, since i probably never even read wikipedia's own definition, recently or historically, but i remember somewhat vividly what it was on its own origins.

big tk, indeed!
