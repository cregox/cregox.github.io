# {{ page.description }}

it's easy to come up with arbitrary summaries in retrospect.

basiux is no more. the result was [a small presentation in a "reach for the moon" event on a London Google office](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DK74wJMQrUDRP2wS7). for my mom. she was filming it. so happily and satisfied, she has been glowing ever since. the first and last presentation of the project. she had missed, after all, [the first and only theater play he had produced](/proud).

the site is now obsolete. probably too buggy. the idea was transformed into something else and the will evolved into [another goal. a reachable one](/ahoxus). but that subjective result, a radiant mother, will endure.

it was worth it.

# 2020

for now, just wanted to mention i've tried (back in july 9th) [replika](https://replika.ai), after [this nice article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287966/openai-commercial-product-text-generation-gpt-3-api-customers) and gpt3 is surely amazing... but it's by far not there yet.

it's too commercial. perhaps even dumbed down, but probably just not smart enough. i got to level 5 of conversation, after a few days. she can analyze context and remember conversation, but in such a artificial way that it will look awful to most smart people.

# more?

below, outdated data points, perhaps still somewhat relevant.

project in hiatus almost since its [launch](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/blob/76498bfeee42d1d458c1554bb00615254337eeff/index.html), [days](https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/tree/76498bfeee42d1d458c1554bb00615254337eeff) before [open.ai's](https://blog.openai.com/introducing-openai/) in Dec 2015 [#envy](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel-about-the-other-novel).

although [the website](https://basiux.github.io) may not make it clear, this is basically a named-one-man-idea that grew into [experiences](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-artificial-intelligence-in-a-video-game-in-history), own learning through [research](https://plus.google.com/collection/8JTrh) and [meetings](https://www.meetup.com/basiux-lisbon/), and [nothing else](http://cregox.net/talk/t/about-the-basiux-category/7683.html).
