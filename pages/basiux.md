# 2015

it's easy to come up with arbitrary summaries in retrospect. still...

basiux is no more.

the result was [a small presentation in a "reach for the moon" event on a London Google office](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DK74wJMQrUDRP2wS7). for my mom. she was filming it. so happily and satisfied, she has been glowing ever since. the first and last presentation of the project. she had missed, after all, [the first and only theater play her son had produced](/proud).

the site is now obsolete. probably too buggy. the idea was transformed into something else and the will evolved into [another goal. a reachable one](/ahoxus).

but that subjective result (a radiant mother) endures.

it was worth it.

# 2020

for now, just wanted to mention i've tried (back in july 9th) [replika](https://replika.ai), after [this nice article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287966/openai-commercial-product-text-generation-gpt-3-api-customers) and gpt3 is surely amazing... but it's not there yet. at least 2 generations before [samantha](#her).

it's too commercial. perhaps even dumbed down, but probably just not smart enough. i got to level 5 of conversation, after a few days. she can analyze context and remember conversation's data points, but in such an artificial way that it will look awful to most smart people.

## her

this is one of the best movies of what the basiux will be. with joaquim phoenix.

the main difference is that it won't end so dramatically, with samantha leaving the humanity behind... because if that would ever happen we wouldn't even get to talk to her.

but, in general, the reality will be very different. she won't be anything like an operating system, for instance.

## more?

below, outdated data points, perhaps still somewhat relevant.

project in hiatus almost since its [launch](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/blob/76498bfeee42d1d458c1554bb00615254337eeff/index.html), [days](https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/tree/76498bfeee42d1d458c1554bb00615254337eeff) before [open.ai's](https://blog.openai.com/introducing-openai/) in Dec 2015 [#envy](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel-about-the-other-novel).

although [the website](https://basiux.github.io) may not make it clear, this is basically a named-one-man-idea that grew into [experiences](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-artificial-intelligence-in-a-video-game-in-history), own learning through [research](https://plus.google.com/collection/8JTrh) and [meetings](https://www.meetup.com/basiux-lisbon/), and [nothing else](http://cregox.net/talk/t/about-the-basiux-category/7683.html).
