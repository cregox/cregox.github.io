![death]({{ page.image }})

on 2020 july 10th i almost got my car stuck in an off road slope hole again (i'll later add some pictures from the first time TK). this time, once more, i got tricked by bad google maps to even go there. thankfully, my previous experience saved me from bigger issues this time. plus, this pushed me to finally switch to [open source maps, osm](https://osmand.net/), which i had installed for some months (*and* even paid for) but haven't switched because of favourites (marks on the map) mostly.

or so i thought.

# remarks

- this page is also heavily inspired by [edward cant](https://pornblock.co.uk/), starting with his "delete facebook", probably the most recent endeavor there.

- [obviously](/privacy) i **strongly** disagree with the focus on privacy concerns.

- the good side effect on this is they end up increasing [redundancy](/backup) in the right way, such as with [secure scuttlebutt](/scuttlebutt).

- death is part of life. and it will always be. it's what makes it beautiful.

- similarly, forgetting is part of remembering. and deleting is part of creating...

- i'll soon start to "delete" **everything** i have from the big ones. gradually. including github. and replace them for better things. still need to find, for instance, a better (and free) place for my [[google](/google)] photos, notes, music, etc... especially the videos.

- by "etc" i mean some easy ones such as youtube, gboard, translate, podcasts, gmail, or news; some i don't really care enough, but would be nice to find a nice open alternative like pixel recorder, earth, fit, or lens; then the ones quite hard to replace: drive, camera, pixel buds, nokia, and i'm still probably missing at least one more.

- and i'll not really delete any data from free hosting. i'll just stop using them. for these things, they're basically the same, with the added benefit of an extra backup point.

- as for the dog, you know the drill. euthanasia should have always been legal, that is, if the legal system was ever to be right.

- then again, find your center, inner piece, etc. mine [was in portugal](/tamera) and still [is](/ahoxus). no idea what it'll [b](/basiux)e. just that [it will be](/fun)!

- boy, it'll be hard to transform this into a [nice](/credibility) "giving" text. although all my content is usually very giving, almost everyone seem to find it too hard to digest! 😒 i'm getting better... 😏

# humanity

they basically have products and services that might even be technically good (google), although they're mostly really not (microsoft)...

but what they all have in common is complete lack of humanity (facebook), meaning they don't care for each person as a person. numbers is all that matters.

how to turn around?

there's no shortcut an no easy way. [ahoxus](/ahoxus) is my personal answer, and it can work for literally anyone... but in practice, it doesn't. because it's hard. freaking hard to transition.

# list

list of deleted apps.

on the first few days, just to begin with...

hangouts

skype

whatsapp

tinder

bumble

messenger

facebook

i will eventually delete even [[telegram](/telegram)] too (not yet)

# outdated

i went through [alternatives](https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-encrypted-messaging-services/) and looking for different [sources (privacy law compliant sounds like a good reference)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cross-platform_instant_messaging_clients).

from those so far, there are about 5 candidates... signal is not friendly to multiple devices and it breaks sms way too often. wickr is too extreme on privacy, harmful even. wire i'll still try again, but unless it offers more than telegram i won't switch just for better privacy. i need [decentralised](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols)! so my best bets are now on xmpp, matrix, and jami (mattermost doesn't offer free hosting and keybase is only at the google store for some reason). there's also the weird odd ball "easy join" i found by accident... not to mention [this list](https://www.geckoandfly.com/20552/encrypted-secure-message-chat/) i still have to go through because it points out the single most important aspect of every app that should be: [decentralised](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-decentralized-internet-and-how-new-ios-and-android-mobile-apps-will-work-545938afe3ea). remember, the internet? 

# new

[delta chat](/delta chat) is amazing! but still not enough to fully replace telegram. even when combined with...

jitsi. that's because neither can **call**. a very important feature!

# history

> history edition might be mostly lost in git history, like the rest of this website, but it's still visible there somewhere.

facebook was harder to delete because too many people i was in contact with through that alone!

and google is everywhere, with irreplaceable conveniences such as maps street view. but i'm still slowly doing it with [[disroot](/disroot)], and [[lbry](/lbry)]. and going [much deeper into degoogling](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/wiki)... the hardest one of them all to delete!

this is a very practical stance on trying to expose the technical issues with too many things out there. and better enjoy the ride. 😘
