- _looking for [[stfw](/stfw)]?_

# {{ page.description }}

[![{{ page.gallery }}]({{ page.image }})](/gallery#{{ page.gallery }})

what is [[love](/love)]?

on the internet, being able to search is what made it actually useful. search is second only to the other key computer feature which is also way to often forgotten: [[redundancy](/backup)].

yes, search is everything! at least when we can search everything.

and, yet, it's almost nowhere to be found for way too many little things. like books. anyone still use a dictionary to find the meaning of a word or a paper map to navigate while driving? why are we still so inexplicably using books to search our souls? anyway...

more importantly, it's feature almost always readily available on a desktop and online but almost completely ignored on mobile!

ok, i mean android, but i bet it's the same in every smartphone.

there is no way to simply search for everything on my phone, you know, like with spotlight, ripgrep, or [[google](/google)]. ok, even windows also have nothing since gds was abandoned... but i couldn't care less for [[windows](/microsoft)].

i just wanted to hit search and find my data (which could all be [[public](/public)] for all i care) whatever kind of data: email, calendar, files, notes, chat, clipboard history, somewhere online, contact notes, map pins etc.

but since [that probably won't happen anytime soon](https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/issues/1621), i might have to [build](/disroot) it somehow (for sure, using [[kiss](/kiss)])...

but don't hold your breath! technically i don't even know where to begin.
