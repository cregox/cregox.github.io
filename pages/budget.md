![my wallet]({{ page.image }})

# {{ page.description }}

born in 1981, 39 years old now.

my maximum yearly income, is around a normalized usd $10k.

minimum (after zero) is probably around 3k, since my 17th birthday.

medium i would guess 8k.

that's it. that's my budget.

almost 20 years working with computers. at least 12 full board full stack programming. mostly web, but even embedded system and firmware protocols i've played with.

today, 2020, it's almost 0. since early 2018. counting with savings and lending and lots of solidary economy, it might reach 7k.

everything i own, except for a microwave and a "bimby", fits into the truck of my 1992 Renault 19, a car that's half mine, bought for 800 eur. plus a backpack.

there's also the caravan, or trailer, which is kind of mine, but only as part of the [[ahoxus](/ahoxus)] community project.

i am the (financially) poorest person i know in my circle of friends and family, financially speaking. probably the top 10 among my 150 closest people, or outer circle.

yes, top 10! it's great to be able to live a very fulfilling life with 0 income. frightening, culturally speaking. everyday i have to remind me just how lucky i actually am.

for a bit more on my budget today, there's also some data under [a recent update](https://ahoxus.org/paradise#reality) on [ahoxus](/ahoxus).

# wallet

i've been tracking my personal finance very closely since february 2020, using budget bakers wallet app. it's quite an amazing app in general, but too limited for the things it can't do, such as backup (there's export and import, but don't you think you'll have all your data backed up even with this).

and i wanted to migrate to andreale94 moneywallet, which is [[open source](/open)] and, as such, much more complete. although it doesn't offer bank sync and i just noticed the backup is rather limited too... and it only have a very small number of graph reports.

they both lack on data standardisation, which makes any export attempt very painful, especially on mobile.

not sure what will be my next app... but it's something not too far from this second one anyway.
