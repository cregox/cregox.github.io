there's not much to be said. it's [[free and open software done right](/foss)]. and it's great for [[degoogling](/delete)]!

there are many similar platforms (such as the [[social](/social)] ones) out there, trying to do the same... but this one hooked me up because of their amazing attempt of a better DNS.

i even created a channel to "pirate" [from youtube](https://odysee.com/@youtube:c2) there, whenever i want to share a youtube video and have the time and patience to manually feed it.

if you own the video, [let me know](/contact). i got no idea how lbry work for transferring ownership, but we can find a way to make this right. i'm making zero money out of this.

all the LBC i might earn there (if any) will untouched and waiting for the rightful owner... until the license becomes public domain. i guess.
