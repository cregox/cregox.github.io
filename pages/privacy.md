simply put, privacy is mostly needed to secure lives from violence. right?

but... what if there's no way to have both privacy and freedom while living in a public space?

picture a lone person living in a completely isolated **island**. it's a full 100% private life. and it's also fully free.

what if we add another person in the same island? it's easy to picture how now there's a public space if they share any boundaries. even a single sight or simply making a sound. it's almost impossible, on a small island without any mountains and dense jungle, to escape the public space.

and as long as there is such a place that's shared between the two lone islanders, there will not be 100% privacy there. the more privacy each one gets, the less freedom they have.

simple enough, right?

you want privacy for improving security, forfeit freedom.

you want freedom for fear of limitation, forfeit privacy.

you want both, give up on public spaces.

and yes, a city is always a public space for, at least, noise intensity. not only sound, even an isolated chamber is taking space and making *noise* in the "space taking" sphere (and it will be taxed, but that's another story).

so, that defines the "only one in the world (or island) freedom", or just **island world** for short. in a world with just one person, we get:

- full privacy
- full freedom
- zero population

let's get into some more definitions...

# right to be forgotten

now... where does the "right to be forgotten" enter in this formula?

> side note: for full disclosure, i strive myself for 100% freedom and completely giving up on privacy. as far as i'm concerned, if i'm not living in a war zone, nor am i working for the army/secret service, my safety is covered already.

deleting data, in any format, is claiming for privacy. not releasing data to the public is exactly the same. both are legal rights associated with "freedom".

it is indeed a free will exerted for the individual. but it actually decreases the freedom level for the group of people, who now doesn't have the right to know what was the data, or what it is.

fair enough, it's easy to picture that giving a bank password away or your home address is an invitation to thieves...

but...

how about giving away "hey, i'm a thief" data? isn't that the exact same *privacy* right being broken, when we, as a society, need that data to comply with other laws?

in the same way, the walls of castles are built as preventive measures against the lack of power to fully have access to freedom. the island world.

they both create a sort of "freedom cell" inside, while removing freedom from what is outside, like in the island, but for the [[world](/world)].

when data is gone by whatever means, privacy is increased and so the freedom to know about it, or to get inside, is decreased.

in a world where everyone can be forgotten to get full privacy rights, nobody is free because there are walls everywhere! this is the **castle world**:

- full privacy
- zero freedom
- full population

# science versus memory

if we know who did what at all times, we don't need to build walls. because we know not only who did it, but who's doing it. and even who is planning to do whatever.

there's no individual freedom anymore, but that brings on the group freedom to its fullest.

but how can we produce a piece of cloth to protect a child from the cold that can also be used by an adult? it doesn't fit! it clearly belongs to the child. so how can there be "no possession"? "no privacy"?

there's no simple answer to how a zero privacy world in a planet filled with humans would look like, but those worlds have always existed in about every other context.

the cloth that only fits in the child can be used by other children. in a world with only 1 adult and 1 child, the cloth could be used only by the child as a cloth and still be used by the adult for whatever other use if there's one that makes sense, because nobody takes it as an ownership. because everyone choose to keep it free for the group, rather than the individual.

such a world requires a lot of imagination and change from our current one. even dealing with [[death](/death)] must be different. in such a world, there's no [[trolley paradox](/trolley)].

in it we must recognize that one of the major aspects of science is not relying on memory, because the [[brain](/brain)] forgets very easily (to stay healthy). yet, we need to remember as much as possible, using all means within reach, as to "keep the castle walls down".

we are, actually, slowly moving away from the fragile "sand" castle world.

this is the **[imagine](/ahoxus#imagine) world**:

- zero privacy
- full freedom
- full population

and this is the only world i want to live in.
