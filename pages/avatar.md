# {{ page.description }}

[![{{ page.image }}]({{ page.image }})](/gallery#{{ page.gallery }})

i must have had about 6 such images since the beginning of the internet, and 3 since i started to use my own picture.

soon i should add them all here...

keep in mind there's [a lot more](/random) about [avatars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/avatar) than you might think, such as why gravatars should still be used, even with [all its flaws](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4553/can-we-use-non-gravatar-avatars).
