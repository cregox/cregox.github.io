![what is comm? baby don't hurt me...]({{ page.image }})

would you agree that [a book](/books) is a form of communication?

how about a speech? or [tv](/tv)?

communication is not always a 2 way street.

> Communication is the act of conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic rules.

fair enough? we can go into more details very easily, thanks to wikipedia:

> The main steps inherent to all communication are: 
> 
> 1. The formation of communicative motivation or reason. 
> 
> 2. Message composition. 
> 
> 3. Message encoding. 
> 
> 4. Transmission of the encoded message as a sequence of signals using a specific channel or medium. 
> 
> 5. Noise sources such as natural forces and in some cases human activity begin influencing the quality of signals propagating from the sender to one or more receivers. 
> 
> 6. Reception of signals and reassembling of the encoded message from a sequence of received signals. 
> 
> 7. Decoding of the reassembled encoded message. 
> 
> 8. Interpretation and making sense of the presumed original message.

notice how that's one way, one dimension, but still requires 2 points: a sender and a receiver.

the best way to communicate, however, requires feedback. that's why the expression focus on the "2 way street". without feedback, communication could almost be defined as broadcasting!

just keep in mind to keep the harmonic unbalanced balance of life, and that too much feedback can also make it the worst way.

# online

perhaps one of the first forms of online communication was irc. internet relay chat.

it still is the best free and open tool for chatting, to this day. except...

in other words and in short, irc sucks big balls. for the same reasons forums (even the [brand new 2.0 #](#forums)) do: nobody really uses them (including myself). outside of the geek realm, anyway.

unlike facebook and twitter... ah, [[twitter](/twitter)]... why did you have to be [[closed](/oss)]? and no, [[mastodon](/mastodon)] sadly isn't better than the little blue bird, yet.

then what?

email.

and [[delta chat](/delta chat)]. you never heard of it? it doesn't matter. it uses email as a protocol!

# libre

telegram is far superior than whatsapp because it's at least **trying** to be [[open and foss](/foss)]. in practice, it doesn't matter so much, other than being a great example went doing just "free and open" isn't enough... but it works wonderfully (technically far superior than all the rest) and it's a good start in a good direction.

signal, in the other hand, is so [[freaking private](/privacy)] that suddenly it's too easy to lose data! man i hate [[losing data](/backup)]!!

TK please, just keep it simple, smart (reference to [kiss versus niagara](https://github.com/8bitPit/Niagara-Issues/issues/180#issuecomment-686421514)... and [[libre](/open)]), and [[redundant](/redundancy)] (backup friendly).

again, delta chat for the win...

# forums

- "2.0" with discourse, nodebb and the daily wtf

![people hotly debating online, or a scene from girl boss](discussing.jpg)

back when i compared the 2, 
discourse.org still rocked hard, both on UX and features. except for Jeff's abusive censorship.

nodebb is the spin off which couldn't handle emails properly, or at all.

and dailywtf are the guys who got expelled and bashed by @codinghorror and helped me open my eyes to this non minor issue.

huge TK here! üòÅ

edit: the best alternative, i found out just recently, is a mailing list such as the one from [sourcehut](/sourcehut). simple, free, libre, foss, etc. the only issue i found there, so far, is the 80 chat limit mindset which makes the website nearly unreadable on mobile. also sadly, delta chat still doesn't work with mailing lists... but any good email client do. k9 and fairemail are good instances.

dec 16th update: there's a second best alternative: [[fossil-scm](/fossil)]. you can host your own markdown forums on you mobile even. or simply take it from another host anywhere and it out offline. it's everything above and more, but it ain't really simple since it requires the command line. it's my every intention to integrate it within [[achoz](/achoz)] and make it simple. it will be either this, a mixture with sourcehut, a merged fork from both, or something very similar.

# offline

also remember that offline first is crucial!

both delta and email clients already know this, of course.
