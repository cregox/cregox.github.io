i've been trying to write these manifestos as something helpful to you.

at some point i realized i'm the one who might need help the most... and i wrote a lot about why.

and, then, i noticed: i don't really need it the most! so i deleted everything i had written here before. it'll be forever "lost" in the source (since i hardly [delete](/delete) anything, [ever](/backup)). for now, it's up to you to figure out what that means, but the answer is in this page.

[[thanks](/thanks)] for all my new (even if only temporary) online friends for keeping me in perspective.

as for the beatles... it actually spells NUJV, as i came to learn today thanks to (in order of my findings) [duck images](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=help+beatles&ia=images&iax=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Fwoodstockwhisperer.info%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fthe_beatles_help_semaphore_error.jpg{{ site.duck }}), [woodstock whisperer](https://woodstockwhisperer.info/2016/08/06/1965-beatles-release-help-album/) (ugliest site), [the](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=beatles+help+nujv{{ site.duck }}) [[duck](/duck)] again,  [feelnumb](http://www.feelnumb.com/2009/03/31/the-beatles-nujv-help/) (kinda nice), and [snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/beatles-help-album-cover/) (so much better). and it means nothing, but we know they meant "we don't actually need help, move on".

meanwhile, please [let me know](/contact) if you need my help. or if, by any [chance](/random), you might want to help me. i love to be in either end of helping hands! ðŸ¥°
