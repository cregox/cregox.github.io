- _looking for [[search](/search)]?_

# {{ page.description }}

![{{ page.image }}]({{ site.image_path }}{{ page.image }})

this is my favourite acronym, since i [[deleted](/delete)] fucking [[google](/google)]. things like [lmgtfy](https://lmgtfy.com) were kind of fun, but...

now i prefer to use the direct [[fuck](/fuck)]. very simple, straightforward and self explanatory. some might find it [[rude](/rude)]. well, fuck you. it'll be good, i promise. ðŸ˜˜
