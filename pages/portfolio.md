_that boomerang ain't gonna fly itself!_

born "caue rego" (plus more names) and turned into web "cregox", i'm just a [random](/random) dude (who loves boomerangs!).

i also once was a programmer, among many related computer titles... for about 20 years, until 2018 or so. since [[tamera](/tamera)] in 2019, i'm reinventing myself.

<small>unlike my [projects](/projects), including the ones i'm [proud](/proud), this is a (non extensive) list that should be at least _somewhat_ useful to you. even if only for you to have some [fun](/fun)!</small>

- [ahoxus](/ahoxus) is my life project, started around june 2019. lots of content around my current quest, building a crisis-prepared life, away from the cities, that may inspire you. there's also a voiceless [short film](https://lbry.tv/@ahoxus:4/ahoxus-we-are-nature:d) there, with original soundtrack from my friend!
- [feeling nostalgic? pcsedados](/pcsedados) we (me and my friend) made back in 2003 and was in use for almost 17 years. cool little story but, above all, has pictures from an old age internet.
- [abaixa tampa (lower the toilet lid)]({{ site.a.abaixatampa }}) if you know me, perhaps you never knew i've got brad pitt jolie acting skills! co-wrote and co-stared in this play, as a bailarina tramp. here are the [photos]({{ site.a.caue.abaixatampa }}) to _prove it_.
- [just a regular damme day]({{ site.a.damme }}) is my "before fame" video (before first acting lessons or anything related to plays, really). so, it should be specially fun for you to watch if you've met me before. i hope.
- [formigas](/formigas) was my adaptation from atari game. more nostalgia? are you a kind of a gamer person? if you also like to code, this is for you! else, you might want to skip it.
- [some photos for casting](/casting), lol. if you enjoy feeling ashamed for other people.
- [homemade]({{ site.a.youtube }}) [videos](/videos) are 2 links where you can find more shameless trash i've recorded in motion.
- [i advise against building resumes](/nocover). you see, [mine](/resume) was even fun to create and maintain, but never gave me anything. because resumes don't bring work! networking and profiles meant to [help](/thanks) others, do.
