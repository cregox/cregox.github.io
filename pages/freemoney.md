- _looking for [[libre](/libre)]?_

first, what does "free money" even mean?

i actually meant it as in "free the money" or "free willy". to set money free!

but you probably came here for the topic around getting easy money for everyone. extinguishing poverty.

or at least for you. right?

you're not like everyone, are you?

well, sorry. what you (may) have in mind for "free money" is obviously impossible. a paradox. a logic failure or language bug.

# hope

there's at least one way to make it better, though. your life. everyone's. free of money, or without money...

we're calling the idea [[ahoxus](/ahoxus)].

there's nothing new to it. it's simply a good collection of current ideas already working in reality. a [[checklist](/checklist)], if you will. ideas around self sufficiency, solidarity, and reciprocacy.

TK another overview about ahoxus, from the free money perspective. very similar from the idea around [[advertising](/ads)].

(it's quite possible to get the idea by just going through the links, but, anyway...)
