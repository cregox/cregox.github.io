[formigas](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17273607/#player) is a tiny game i've made using MIT's "Scratch" visual language, in 5 days from january [2014](/2014).

you can still see it working in 2020, but only really if you have a physical keyboard or some way to emulate the arrow keys.

it was inspired by the same game made back in the 90's, around 1996 i believe, when cregox was at most 15 years old, using QBasic on DOS.

which, in turn, was a copy of an atari game called Labyrinth. i've used Gorilla's code mixed with another code from an MSX 3D labyrtinh book game, together with a lot of nested if's.

both were quite fun to build.

i thought next time, i would make an adaptation to javascript with some more interesting twist... but if i ever do this again, it'll be in yet another unexpected future event.
