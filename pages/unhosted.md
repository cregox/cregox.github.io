_looking for [[hosting](/hosting)]?_

# {{ page.description }}

![{{ page.image }}]({{ site.image_path }}{{ page.image }})

this website will become [unhosted](http://unhosted.org/tools/) as soon as possible. and turned into a [[pwa](/pwa)]. because [that](/free)'s how the internet should be!

the will is to make it like a mix between [[mediawiki](/wiki)] and [[git](/git)] (current form):

- no central user registration (git) to prevent things like [banning users and elections](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki:Timeline)
- easy to contribute on the web (wiki) because github is still too hard for most (plus [github sucks](/github))
- easy history log, compare, blame, and page visual (wiki) sadly git doesn't make that last part possible, and no other part easy
- pull, push, sync, done (git) to decentralised wiki

and to add a self validated blockchain/torrent like list of recognized domains who form the whole network of manifestos (in a way similar to [tosdr](https://tosdr.org/about.html)) such that it would be like a **decentralised wikipedia**.

there's probably a lot to learn from [[mastodon](/mastodon)] and such.

wondering now if anyone done this already... too bad it's so hard to [[stfw](/stfw)] for unnamed concepts!
