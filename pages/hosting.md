![tk]({{ page.image }})

you'll need git, android, termux, and many hours of free time! nothing else. no money. no computer. 

for now, you'll also need github pages and jekyll... but i'll soon migrate that into netlify and gatsbyjs or something, because of pwa and microsoft...

# termux

instructions to everything else is fairly easy to find online.

get it on fdroid. anything that's on the play store and fdroid is usually better (and more free) from fdroid. different mindset!

then, from [nokogiri's](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html):

```
pkg install ruby clang make pkg-config libxslt
gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries
```
