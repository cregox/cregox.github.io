# email


dear jimmy,  
  
i wrote this message over 1 week ago (oct 29th). sending in only now hoping it'll have better chances to be read by you, mr w. i haven't edited it since.  
  
i love your work and all the little things i got to know about you. i [really](https://cregox.net/really) do.  
  
but:  
  
- i don't have money to keep giving every time wiki ask. in fact, financially speaking, i am indeed remarkably and willingly poor. cregox.tk/money  
  
- i can live very happily without wikipedia.  
  
- i still think wikipedia needs to find a better sustainable way to live. i can't agree with this way you've been doing those 20 years.  
  
- the mediawiki could be revolutionising... but it's rather stagnant for the past 20 years! so disappointing imho.  
  
that being said...  
  
how much would you need me to pay you so i can speak to you about this? not some representative, but you. for as long as it takes.  
  
depending on the amount, i'll gladly "donate" one last time (or until i get financially rich).  
  
i want wikipedia for the people, and i know in my bones that it is possible to make this work without needing to ever **ask** for donations by any means.  
  
no, i don't have any specific knowledge about the whole wiki background, or you. for all things wiki, i'm just a consumer.  
  
yes, i'm a "nobody" compared to you. but i just had enough of bullshit.  
  
if you don't want to even write over email about this, i'll just unsubscribe, mark it as spam, and be gladly just another of those 98% of users, or even, eventually, [delete](https://cregox.net/delete) wikipedia (either because you might want to ban me for whatever reason, because i find something better, or because i become certain that this is a detrimental model).  
  
and thank you so much for all the ride so far. [wikipedia](https://cregox.net/wiki) meant the world to me!  
  
✌️ps: i've made this email public at https://cregox.net/jimmy  
  
cheers!

> At every turn, we have been pressured to compromise our values, and I'll be honest: **We've had enough**. People always ask us, why not just run ads to make revenue? Or capture and sell reader data? Or make everyone pay to read? While these things seem like the norm online nowadays, we'd like to remind you that there is another way -- a way that won't jeopardize the neutrality of our content and threaten your personal data. We just ... ask! Not often, but it works. So after two decades of saying no, I can still say we are proud to have left that money on the table.  
>   
> We’re a nonprofit. Only 2% of our readers give, but we manage to serve hundreds of millions of people per month. Imagine if everyone gave? We could transform the way knowledge is shared online.  
>   
> Every year, I’m happily stunned by the response from our donors. But we haven’t reached our fundraising goal, and we don’t have a lot of time left. We’re not salespeople. We’re librarians, archivists, and information junkies. We rely on our readers to become our donors, and it’s worked for 19 years.  
>   
> This year, please consider making another donation to protect and sustain Wikipedia.

> **If everyone who used Wikipedia this year donated, we wouldn’t need to fundraise for years to come. But only 2% of our readers give. We’re sustained by the support of our donors, who choose to do something exceptional.**
