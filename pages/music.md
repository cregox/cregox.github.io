![ok, a dead tree may not be the most descriptive image of a soul... but close enough?]({{ page.image }})

### {{ page.description }}

to me, a dancing soul can be translated into a tingling brain. singing along is advised! skipping the songs you may not enjoy, as well. those lists are quite [random](/random) or ecletic, given my limitations.

those may need a desktop to play on the background:

- [long list over the years, 3 options to play the list, under "about"to the right](https://www.last.fm/user/cawas)

- [you know, the tubes...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL28DE3A85A7D3FA81)

there are plenty solutions to convert those to you favorite background player, such as videoder on android.
