![ok, a dead tree may not be the most descriptive image of a soul... but close enough?]({{ page.image }})

### {{ page.description }}

to me, a dancing soul can be translated into a tingling brain. singing along is advised! skipping the songs you may not enjoy, as well. those lists are quite [[random](/random)] or ecletic, given my limitations.

those **may need a "_desktop_"** to play on the background:

- [long list over the years on last.fm, 3 options to play the list, under "about"to the right](https://www.last.fm/user/cawas), probably only visible on a desktop. most mobile browsers can request a desktop page (stfw for it), and it should also work.

- [you know, the freaking tubes...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL28DE3A85A7D3FA81) for now.

there are plenty of solutions to convert those to you favorite background player, such as videoder on android.
