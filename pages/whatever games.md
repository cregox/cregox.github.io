### {{ page.description }}

here's a time ordered and incomplete list of good games i've played online under the nickname of [cawas](/cawas), [cregox](/) (starting on vainglory), or eventually something with ["ahoxus"](/ahoxus).

{% for from in page.redirect_from  %}
- [{{ from }}](/{{ from }})
{% endfor %}

i enjoyed them for many long hours!

this page is [[really](/really)] just a placeholder for you, who [[stfw](/stfw)] for me using something like "cregox ragnarok".
