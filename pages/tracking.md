![tk]({{ page.image }})

simply put: in the long run, to the world, it doesn't add any benefit.

[i'm completely against the gdpr](/privacy). yet, cookies and tracking in general should still be discouraged, but for sustainable reasons.

yes, it can help profit for the first year, or even 10 years, of your endeavour.

but at what cost?

you see, the whole picture is that we all benefit from the whole when we the whole can benefit from each one of us.
