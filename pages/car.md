the basic math for sharing the car is:

- 0.30 eur per kilometer: it makes about 7 L/km, plus maintenance and savings.
- keep it clean: sadly it doesn't clean itself up.
- keep the fuel tank above half: the old engine can't take too much of the accumulated dirt on the bottom of the gas tank airways being filled with cheap gas.
- check the schedule: so everyone can enjoy the ride!
