# {{ page.description }}

inspired by a [comment on medium](https://link.medium.com/J73Rb8HjJZ).

programming languages are also, in practice, a human attempt to create a communication protocol completely based on logic. and it's so powerful that it can clearly, given enough resources, simulate our whole reality!

think about it. a simple tool to communicate allows us to talk among ourselves and computers in such a way that we can potentially create everything. every single thing.

## free

and it's only possible, historically, because we've made it as easy as possible for everyone to join in. opening up everything we can. linux, internet, and so many things in the computer world are open sourced in this foss way, completely **[[free](/free)]**.

software is to computer language the same as culture is to human language. it's a complex conjunction of data, combined by simple words and ideas, that allows for quick execution and understanding of something. you either know, culturally, what i mean by "life is a box of chocolates" or you don't. and if you don't, then you need to "download" the "software" that explains what that means (like [[stfw](/stfw)]), or else it is just mumbojumbo to you.

leaving the source code inaccessible, thus, is the same, in a human level of software, as creating your own culture (such as a dialect or films) and never revealing them to other people outside your allowed circle. it's creating scarcity of data, and trying to [[monetize](/capitalism)] on ignorance. including of whom is doing it.

## source

just open **everything** up by whatever means!

oss ain’t easy. there’s too much that needs to be done to maintain it in a useful manner for anyone else. we know...

there are many ways to open a source code, though. if enough people just do it the easy and dirty way - **without bothering about other people or spending any extra time or energy to open it** (like we do it here!) - eventually some projects will be picked up from dust. and we’ll learn how to do it for more and more.

keep the [[faith](/random)]!

## libre

[stallman from gnu and free software foundation fsf](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) explains the difference between floss, foss, and libre.

the whole idea here is a bit of a mixture from there.

just [[stfw](/stfw)] and you'll quickly see that nobody talks about floss outside of the [[dental](/dental)] realm. only foss. and libre comes in all kinds of flavors, not only nor primarily software.

foss here is free open source as in libre. it's not about financial cost, it's about software freedom so we can advance it better and faster for everyone. very practical and technical, there's just nothing that compares.

this is a political statement. but also so much more than that: it's a philosophical and logical statement.

ps: the [[internal links](/wiki)] in here are often very, very important for context and understanding.
