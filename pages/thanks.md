how to touch people? you know, deep inside. the right way. offer [gratitude](https://web.archive.org/web/20180911073305/https://curiosity.com/topics/see-how-your-gratitude-stacks-up-with-this-gratitude-survey-curiosity/)

we all know how. it's simple. just do our best, pay attention to each situation.

not always will it be pleasent. spreading love can be pretty hard!

so, are we doing it nearly as much as we should?

no idea.

i used to list some people here who i'm thankful for, by name. humans who touched me recently, even if ever so slightly or critically.

instead, i'll list them by some random identifier... because i realize now that not everyone is very comfortable with publicity of their names.

## update timeline

# 2019 may, first draft

this list started as a thank you to curtiss "gigi" murphy, from game design zen. after hearing [the only episode i'll hear](http://www.goodgamesbydesign.com/2015/08/003-level-up-portfolios-finishing-and-next-steps/) from his boring podcasst, about leveling up portfolios.

my best friend guzforster pointed me to it, thinking i could use some "portfolio advice" about stepping down and creating small projects (as if i hadn't created enough of them).

the thing is, i truly haven't. not with the right attitude, at least, of truly helping others.

and the funny part is that i know for a fact i've touched other people with whatever crap i've done, thanks to more good friends... and probably what i do better, finished project wise, is always related to programming. despite all my eforts against it.

so, there you go. coincidentally, i even decided to start this page just because i could find nowhere to publicly thank gigi. and now i hope this can start something beautiful!
