# {{ page.description }}

![{{ page.image }}]({{ site.image_path }}{{ page.image }})

i've been [using it for a few years now](https://t.me/cregox_tv). sometimes i still post [[updates](/updates)] about this site in there, and nowhere else.

# because

unlike whatsapp, it's easy to have 1 account in several devices or many accounts in 1 device. whichever you like. it's also easy to migrate data from one device to the other, since everything stays in the cloud.

poor google hangouts don't stand any chance, it stopped in the past and it even started to lose messages.

much better than facebook (messenger), it also offers easy way to search for people in the directory, but it doesn't eat up all your battery or memory, filling up the poor bits and bytes of your cellphone with garbage.

signal could be a good contender, if it wasn't so easy to lose my own data into its way too [private](/privacy) policies... and it even grabs all the sms to lose them all as well!

i won't even get into the smaller ones like skype, viber, icq, wechat, etc.

# second

but since i started to [[delete](/delete)] facebook, google, and all the bad pieces of software (basically anything that's not doing [[foss](/foss)] right), i noticed telegram have 1 major flaw: it offers no user data redundancy, also known as [[backup](/backup)].

not to mention it keeps trying to reinvent the wheel on everything! even on encryption!! so much wasted energy.

**i'll still use it for now**, nevertheless, because it's still so much better than anything else!

but either delta chat, matrix or some jabber variation will soon take over... and i'll be there to enjoy it! üòÅ

# first

delta chat is truly remarkable! it uses emails as the protocol, and it works wonderfully. the main problem, other than the usual small user base, is that it's still too new and like every foss, its development is slow.
