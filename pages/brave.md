[this](https://brave.com/cau981) is my [[referral](/referral)] and what's brave on their own words.

in short:

it's the best browser today.

forget freaking trendy [[privacy](/privacy)] (not even tor will give you that) or getting insignificant pay for terrible ads...

it rocks because it works great everywhere, it's fast (because it blocks [[ads](/ads)]), fully [[OSS](/oss)], and sustainable (for whatever [that](/ahoxus) means)! 

main complain: it was hard to migrate from chrome... it uses chromium, so i thought it should offer some easier way, connecting to google to import or something... i ended up doing manually and little by little.

anyway, turn off the brave ads, learn to be online/public (because there's no such thing as online privacy, ultimately*), and enjoy it.

* unless you really know how feds and hankers can find you and live completely outside "the system"... but keep in mind there's hardly any good reason to go full [[snowden](/snowden)] (in short, he was probably dumb).
