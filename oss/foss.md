## oss is a model for freedom and creation

... in the primordial logic of communication.

programming languages are also, in practice, a human attempt to create a communication protocol completely based on logic. and it's so powerful that it can clearly, given enough resources, simulate our whole reality!

think about it. a simple tool to communicate allows us to talk among ourselves and computers in such a way that we can potentially create everything. every single thing.

and it's only possible, historically, because we've made it as easy as possible for everyone to join in. opening up everything we can. linux, internet, and so many things in the computer world are open sourced in the right way, completely **[[free](/free)]**.

software is to computer language the same as culture is to human language. it's a complex conjunction of data, combined by simple words and ideas, that allows for quick execution and understanding of something. you either know, culturally, what i mean by "life is a box of chocolates" or you don't, and then you'd need to "download" the "software" that explains what that means, or else it is just mumbojumbo to you.

leaving the source code inaccessible, thus, is the same, in a human level of software, as creating your own culture (such as a dialect or films) and never revealing them to other people outside your allowed circle. it's creating scarcity of data, and trying to [[monetize](/capitalism)] on ignorance. including of whom is doing it.

## open it up by whatever means!

oss ain’t easy. there’s too much that needs to be done to maintain it in a useful manner for anyone else. we know…

there are many ways to open a source code, though. if enough people just do it the easy and dirty way - **without bothering about other people or spending any extra time or energy to open it** (like we do it here!) - eventually some projects will be picked up from dust. and we’ll learn how to do it for more and more.

keep the [[faith](/random)]!

ps: the [[internal links](/wiki)] in here are very, very important for context and understanding. they'll eventually even gain a different colour rather than just brackets. can you [imagine](/ahoxus) the colors? (and now, this "imagine" internal link is just a regular one more like a loosely related spin off, like most internal links in this site, on this case because of the association i make between imagine, john, and ahoxus)
