one day we shall move everything into one platform!

but, for now, **the main one is [medium](https://medium.cregox.com)**.

meanwhile...

still got those 3 (not 4 anymore, the one from squarespace is no more):

- [oldest](http://cauecmrego.blogspot.com) (blogspot)
- [archived](http://talk.cregox.com/c/blog) (discourse) used to be also a forum (includes almost* every posts from squarespace).
- [experimental](http://blog.cregox.net) (jekyll) mainly for toying around, I guess. but might become the main one.

# * note

some archive files from discourse have missing links. the categories pagination were badly archived. and this makes google robots fail when trying to find them. but basically everything is there! except for images. anyway, you can further [search and find them within the github](https://help.github.com/articles/about-searching-on-github/) repository (look for the repo link below on the footer).
