![duck]({{ page.image }})

[duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) is by far the most interesting* web search tool since google launched over 20 years ago.

obviously despite of the erradic [[privacy](/privacy)] concerns...

*interesting because it's a new company focusing on search and growing among all the other big ones.

and, hopefully, it'll eventually learn that their focus should be [[opening up](/open)], or someone else will have to arise again.

meanwhile, let's enjoy it. like all the other digital era ones that came before. and keep on [[deleting](/delete)] the rest.
