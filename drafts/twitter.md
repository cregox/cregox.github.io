# {{ page.description }}

people love to ask me (at least in online forms) for my social links, as if it was hard to find them!

so i decided to compile them all here, in order of preference:

# scuttlebutt
uniquely awesome! i'm [using manyverse](/scuttlebutt), but there's still no easy way to link the profile, i think.

# [mastodon](//fosstodon.org/@cregox)
this is almost as good as scuttlebutt, but people actually use it, looks like!

# [twitter](//twitter.com/cauerego)
i actually [love twitter](/unverified), despite so many flaws such as verification and exaggerated minimalism.

# [github](//github.com/cauerego)
in here [my love](/git) is fading away (you know, after ms bs).

# [facebook](//facebook.com/caue.rego)
not as [evil](/moderator) as microsoft, actually.

# [linkedin](//linkedin.com/in/cauerego)
owned and controlled by [microsoft](/microsoft), which is always at least a 51% bad thing.

# kaggle
never heard
