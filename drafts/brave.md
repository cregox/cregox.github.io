[this](https://brave.com/cau981) is my [[referral](/referral)] and what's brave on their own words.

in short:

it's that the best browser.

forget freaking trendy [[privacy](/privacy)] (not even tor will give you that) or getting insignificant pay for terrible ads...

it rocks because it works great everywhere, it's fast (because it blocks [[ads](/ads)]), fully [[OSS](/oss)], and sustainable! 

main complain: it was hard to migrate from chrome... it uses chromium, so i thought it should offer some easier way, connecting to google to import or something... anyway, turn off the ads, learn to be online (in public), and enjoy it.
