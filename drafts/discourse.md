![people hotly debating online, or a scene from girl boss]({{ page.image }})

back when i compared the 2, 
discourse.org still rocked hard, both on UX and features. except for Jeff's abusive censorship.

nodebb is the spin off which couldn't handle emails properly, or at all.

and dailywtf are the guys who got expelled and bashed by @codinghorror and helped me open my eyes to this non minor issue.

i really need to write this mani right and review both again... hoping nodebb finally caught up. or someone else, eventually even with some free hosting...

discourse was still in front even on that aspect, as they offered some interesting free hosting model in 2019 (or was it 2018?).

anyway, bug TK here! üòÅ
