![cawas]({{ page.image }})

# {{ page.description }}

in early 2014 i started to get flooded on twitter by indonesians.

[eventually i discovered](https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-weirdest-Twitter-stories/answer/cregox) a likely cause: there's a region there called cawas.

so i ended up changing my twitter handle from @cawas to @cauerego and slowly moved away from that alias into cregox.

funny enough, today i've got some emails from netflix into my gcawas@gmail probably due to the same reasons.

perhaps i'll have to dig deeper to understand exactly how their language leads to those unexpected events...
