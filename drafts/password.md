[why do they suck?](https://medium.com/cregox/fuck-security-questions-90a7a52551f0)

in short, because there are so many better ways to handle authentication online:

- single sign on
- 2 step auth
- ssh key
- code through email
- no password

eventually i'll go back and elaborate more on each. meanwhile, there's the link(s) above, filled insightful with links inside.

cheers!
