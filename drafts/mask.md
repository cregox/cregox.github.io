![tk]({{ page.image }})

i'm deeply bothered by the ignorance i see around the mask topic.

so i search the web for different word combinations of "mask covid inefficient science proof countries" and try to find a good article.

first one seem to be from a reliable source, and wants to prove wearing masks is good, [no matter what](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/21/880832213/yes-wearing-masks-helps-heres-why?t=1596792996342) and then its main reasoning comes from [this study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext#%20) which doesn't even say that masks really work or anything, really.

dreadful.

then the [next one](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent) comes from a nice college...

same bullshit.

> in fact, no article i've found mentions washing masks and mask hygiene... perhaps they're assuming everyone knows the proper way to wear a mask. we don't. not even in asian countries. and i know this because, unlike condoms and sunglasses, masks are terribly hard to use effectively. no article mention that, but the ones trying to defend the usage are the main ones that should mention it!

why am i even trying to find a good article?

# wait a moment...

not so surprisingly (given it was from wired), but still i was surprised (that it was from wired), to find out in my 3rd attempt!

**[kudos to wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-face-mask-debate-reveals-a-scientific-double-standard/)**! also, this is not really telling us we should wear or not a mask. more kudos!

although it suggests that we should wear it (and i actually agree the policy should be calling people to do so, while i disagree it should be mandatory), it also doesn't give a final word of wisdom because the actual science on it is still inconclusive by all means! just go ahead and compare those articles and their sources.

# that's good, right?

no wonder why the world is filled with so much confusion. it's actually very hard to see the difference between a good source/article and a bad one.

but it's here.

and you can see it by yourself if you stop for long enough to think it through. want to know a bit more about masks and life in general? take your time. stay curious!

# back to the bad

then i moved on to the [4th one](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-why-wearing-masks-controversial)...

back to the same bullshit from the first 2!

they all say it differently, but they all also cherry pick studies and situations which favour their previously conceived expectations: that masks are intrinsically good, or something.

for sure we can get a sense of safety because then we're doing something, and it's simple, and it's obvious by the 2 minutes mechanics how it works: big water droplets will be retained by the mask and won't reach the lungs from other people... if we're lucky, even small particles from other people will stay on our mask too! very logical.

did you know you can wear a condom wrongly and its virtual 98% efficiency will turn into zero? what's more, because you think your protected, you won't do other measures to add up the protection. moral licensing at its best.

exact same thing for sunglasses and sunscreen.

now, where's the "on steroids" part? you may ask...

it's on the sense of protection and the chances of effectiveness.

look at the articles. actually, look also at the worst kind, my 5th and last one for today. [this piece of complete garbage](https://fee.org/articles/new-study-casts-more-doubt-on-effectiveness-of-masks-in-preventing-covid-19-spread/). they mention a study that defend their preconceived expectation and, at very least (and to their merit) soon later they publish how their base study was **retracted** because it was plain wrong!!

anyway...

you'll see different numbers for mask efectiveness all over the place. from 0 to 80%, they never come closer to n95, 95% which, even then, only works if you can keep it clean and tight (hint: you can't. nobody can.)

still, the vast majority of mask promoters and wearer lovers think they're protected. near the 98% protection from the condoms even. why? because nobody knows the difference between 99%, 98%, 80% and 51%. if we tell ourselves "this is better than nothing" we are basically telling us "i'm doing something. something good. i'm at least a little more protected. thanks to my good will." unconsciously. yes, you too.

but the mask doesn't offer so much effectiveness. it still may even not be effective, in a population scale.

we want to believe so hard there's always a simple solution to things... wear a mask. done.

> here's the exception: CDC, linked in wired, does give [instructions to wash masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wash-cloth-face-coverings.html) that nobody follows and nobody will follow. nobody wash their hands for 20 seconds ago the time too.

my whole point here is just one: we need better informed people. and we do need to take all precautions, even wearing masks or a eye patch if there's a chance it'll be effective. but it doesn't mean it'll work. and we also need to have our liberties.

enough about the technicalities, though...

# here's the kicker

vaccines will be absolutely mandatory. physical distance is by far the best method, and only one capable of resetting the pandemic effect, when it gets out of hand.

except for the naive mask recommendations, i can't recommend enough for you to [spend at least 1h and dig into nick's unique article](https://ncase.me/covid-19).

this covid-19 will be contained. but it's just a very small hint on how terrible the system is set. it's set for disaster. to fail miserably. and many more will both live terribly and die because of this.

there can't be life without death. and death is forbidden in our current system. it's even a taboo.

so are pain and bad things.

we don't need this system.

there's a better way, to live with acceptance of life. and death. and suffering. and enjoy it all so much more! be really alive.

i call it [ahoxus](/ahoxus). and you might not believe it, but i don't need you to believe in. take your time. see it for yourself. this isn't for everyone. most people will sadly die much before they can get here. others will simply walk around and genuinely enjoy life without living this.

but if you're also even slightly bothered by how reliant you've grow to be with sunglasses, do take a deep breath and keep digging!

plus, wear seatbelts. those are virtually always good. and do it wrong as well. life will go on.
