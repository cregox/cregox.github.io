fuck, google maps is good. so much so that it still feels far superior than the rest. but [[google is evil](/google)] and so the map suffer.

by far, google **main issue** is the lack of awareness of [what software should even be: always open source](/open)!

everything else on the list of instances below (about how google map sucks and what's the alternative) comes after this concept. remember [[checklists](/checklist)]?

[[deleting](/delete)] maps have been the hardest one from my google list.

- navigation directions work really well: especially good for suggesting alternatives fast. but only if you're going anywhere a lot of people went before. a lot. else, it's safer to not trust it. if this ever happens on openstreetmaps, you can manually fix it, fairly easily and quickily. for everyone.

- [[backup](/backup)] with "takeout" *kinda* works (when it does), but only manually and lots of the data is almost unusuable both to import back into google itself and, thus, anywhere else! not to mention you can wake up one day and have everything lost either by incompetence or unknown banning reasons. yes, it have happened. almost any app alternative will offer a better automated way here. i use map marker with nextcloud.

- real time location sharing works, but only if everyone evolved have a [freaking](/freedom) google account. osm maps don't have many good options for this, but they're there. (except from osmand, that one's terrible!

- list of points on a map sharing only works on a second app (my maps) but not even with a google account can everyone contribute with it easily. it just doesn't offer this functionality. almost any alternative app at least offer easy file sharing, such as map marker.

my current workflow depends on what answer i want from a map, but basically i channel everything through map marker (to keep a good list backup) at some point. and never do i stop or rely only on google maps. a lot of times it's slower, sometimes it's faster, but it's always safer and more sustainable.
