i've been trying to write these manifestos as something helpful to you.

at some point i realized i'm the one who might need help the most...

and, then, i noticed: not really. so i deleted everything i had written here before. it'll be forever "lost" in the source (since i hardly [delete](/delete) anything, [ever](/backup)). for now, it's up to you to figure out what that means, but the answer is in this page.anks](/thanks)] for all my new (even if only temporary) online friends for keeping me in perspective.

meanwhile, please [let me know](/contact) if you need my help. or if, by any [chance](/random), you might want to help me. i love to be in either end of helping hands! ðŸ¥°
