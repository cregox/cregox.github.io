![death]({{ page.image }})

- this is inspired by [edward cant](https://pornblock.co.uk/), starting with his "delete facebook", probably the most recent endeavor there.

- [obviously](/privacy) i **strongly** disagree with the focus on privacy concerns.

- the good side effect on this is they end up increasing [redundancy](/backup) in the right way, such as with [secure scuttlebutt](/scuttlebutt).

- death is part of life. and it will always be. it's what make it beautiful.

- so forgetting is part of remembering. and deleting is part of creating...

- i'll soon start to delete **everything** i have from the big ones. gradually. including github.

- but i'll first create better things in their place. still need to find, for instance, a better (and still free) place for my google photos, notes and music... especially the videos.

- and i'll not really delete any data from free hosting. i'll just stop using them. for this things, they're basically the same, with the added benefit of an extra backup point.

- as for the dog, you know the drill. euthanasia should have always been legal, if the legal system was ever to be right.

- then again, find your center, inner piece, etc. mine [was in portugal](/tamera) and still [is](/ahoxus). no idea what it'll [b](/basiux)e. just that [it will be](/fun)!

- boy, it'll be hard to transform this into a [nice](/credibility) "giving" text. although all my content is usually very giving almost everyone find it too hard to digest! üòí i'm getting better... üòè

cheers! üòò
