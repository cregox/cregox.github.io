what's reality?

and what does it mean to "really want" something?

it's actually our rudimentar way to predict the future using our little understanding of reality.

and reality is our shared perception of existence, that only exists while there's enough people to perceive it.

a physical reality, on the other hand, created by the big bang and set in deterministic motion with ultimate force that can not be changed by our perception, is not our reality. we can only ever have models of that reality which can completely change at any given point. both the model and reality can change in unimaginable ways.

and this manifesto, for now, is a huge TK. sorry #notsorry. ;P
