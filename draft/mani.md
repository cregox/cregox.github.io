this will soon be a checklist of things that a blog 2.0 should do.

like when i've build a list for camera and found narrative and noticed it was still not the time for such a camera to exist yet.

anyway:

- git compatible. jekyll for this mostly right. yes, editing pages should be allowed.

- comments. static like the content. why not?!

- ability to quote. pretty much like medium and discourse.

- responsive. this means easy to embed videos and images that will be optimized for mobile.

- offline. pwa should be default, with web notifications rather than emails. or both.

- easy navigation through edit history. like wikipedia.

- keyword based. rather than posts. this the manifesto kind of format. manis must be frequently updated. again, like wikipedia.

- it's analogous to knowledge sources like encyclopedias and dictionaries, rather than news.

- even if it's a story, it should frequently be updated.

- way more [[TK]].
