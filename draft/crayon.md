this is a [big draft](https://medium.com/@e339ab942529/3723dd82f169?sk=) of a [real story](/story) about nothing. lots of [TK](/TK) because it'll still change a lot.

TK needs to be shortened into smaller pages.

take 4 minutes and enjoy!

picture a crayon.

# the crayon.

and then there was light! and darkness… oops, light again, but a teal colour. what the actual fuck?

(picture every scene transition as a cut-less flow. and a crayon almost everywhere in each scene.)

a teal crayon.

it is removed from the pack, by a kid.

she draws two circles.

the sun shines over the earth.

a spiderman drawing in an old computer. smooth. and superman, pixelated, seen, now, in a new computer.

the now grown up One kid is playing world of warcraft. a computer game, played online by thousands of people at the same time, fighting mostly against computer medieval magical monsters.

beside another virgin grown up. both silently.

the power goes off. all is dark. someone screams an uptight “shit”. there’s silence. and laughter.

the laugh turns into a hospital siren.

red crayon.

surgeries are taking place in One. in the eyes. a simple genital cosmetic. something on a butt.

a fart. turns into shit. garbage. compost. a common recycling cycle in an ecovillage.

a baby is born. and another one.

pink and blue crayons.

a couple having sex. One’s on top. they’re both fully enjoying it. however he cums outside. she’s relieved. he’s exhausted. or was it the other way around? they do it again. and again. every day. a couple of years go by, reducing this vital frequency. once a week. once a month. 10 years later...

they dress up and go together into an office. before they can sit in chairs far apart, suddenly, it is now a beautiful agroforestry (syntropic permaculture). and they’re breaking apart, moving away from each other, sadly, crying. then, an intense hugging and kissing. 

cyan crayon.

the ocean. a sea front view. beautiful balcony. simple apartment. a calm paved street on the front. an annoying night street light. light pollution on the sky.

cars. driving back and forth to work. just a 30 minutes commute through nice green spaces mixed with small towns. a bit tiring. a bit refreshing. no biggies.

friends playing games in the apartment. with the couple. and kids together. none are theirs.

green crayon.

One is in the agroforestry. it turns into monoculture. some beautiful snakes around. and spiders. a few mosquitos. rats. wild boars. yes, tamera.

dancing alone. some people join. so much love, but too much distance. contact dancing. slow and a lot of contact. it ends very quickly. a balloon in the sky. a new person, from outside, just join in. they sit together on the sunset. play fight. and kiss on the ground.

One is now meeting someone from the contact dance. they sleep together in a tent. and have sex. side by side. it was clearly attempted before, but this time penetration worked. then, the next morning it’s good bye.

driving with 2 new friends. one sleeping in the back. two laughing in the front.

leaves them behind, they’ll be hitchhiking now. fun moments.

grey crayon.

someone’s driving. alone. for a long time. in the city. in the mountains. traveling. going to work. basically no laughing. sometimes practicing singing.

cyan crayon.

one note turns into orgastic moaning. now in a bed. two more attractive people, dressed in black, are doing sexual massage to One (who always looks very different, a different person even, but clearly the same soul). it’s no big deal, but there is some learning of new techniques that increasingly improve the sex performance, such as the moaning. still remarkable!

green crayon on the ground.

a hill. a forest in one side. fields in the other. a beautiful green and small canyon with lakes and big rocks in the lake. no cell phone reception.

cyan crayon being thrown.

One meets again with a previous sex partner. they look prettier than before, into each one's eyes. they don't apply any learning from before. have sex twice in the same day, always with condoms. and say good bye again.

150 friends in a party. eros playground. mostly everyone know each other. One's blindfolded in the corner. for a very long time. nobody wants to connect. TK go back to teenager traumas up to 26yo.

new lover partner at the playground. at least for right now. beautiful bald woman. the kiss. and touch each other, except on the genitals. too public for her. 5 minutes, new partner. the man's hosting. too awkward. nothing works anymore.

rainbow crayon.

someone brings a soft feather. gently caressing the mostly motionless blinded One. guiding them to get up. then get down on the knees. get tied up. tied up good. and visibly excited. they talk about One's incapacity to connect intimately with almost every single desired person. how to fix it. untie. say good bye.

instantly back to the bald woman. not a single piece of advice from the dominatrix applied. He blindfolds her. and draw on her. and grabs her everywhere. kiss her on the nipples. she asks to stop. too public. gets tied up. and a bit excited again, not so much about the rope, unlike him, but she even talks about taking it further.

instead, they go cuddle for a while. and then back to a room, cuddle more. she sleeps. he tries, the whole night, but can only get excited about the situation and touching her amazingly hairless and soft skin. everywhere.

black crayon.

the next day, she just wants to meet other people. nothing more happens, after getting up the bed. the magic is gone.

TK world needs harmony, even if all each one of us need is love. and what balance means, yin yang? reality needs it? dunbar number, big numbers, randomness etc.

20191005 why so hard? most people seem to keep thinking i'm needy or a creep just because i'm an open book and want sex. to be myself, however, and perhaps being more transparent in a way that shows the actual confidence people are looking for, i need to play with it. it's not a game, it never was (although life is, kind of). it's a toy. the topic around sex, with attractive women. and, guess what? it works with the very few that dare to be open! most of which that might not have plenty of offers from men for whatever reason. sex can also just be kissing or cuddling. we're all adults. just ask to stop, if needed. i'm actually grateful i have set this filter up so naturally and didn't have to deal with so much childish bullshit from "grown ups". the adult bullshit (such as privacy) is already plenty enough. for me, at least. thank you eros playground in permalab, vivi, matias and alface!
