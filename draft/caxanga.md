# {{ page.description }}

think of flipping a fair coin.

to be considered a fair coin, it will have 50% chance of falling in each face (which isn't true for most coins, by the way, but that's another story).

now think that we actually have any kind of influence over the results of the flip... wait, we actually do! a machine able to put the right force and torque, in a controlled environment, will have [up to a 100% chance of knowing which face will come out](https://news.stanford.edu/pr/2004/diaconis-69.html), even with a fair coin.

(that's how, for instance, ooja boards work, by the way... but that's an even bigger other story)

ok, so what?

what if we can make a virtual coin, with a few hundreds of millions of different and evenly spread out outcomes possible, meaning a 1 chance in say 300 million to get a right result, all based in some local noise, as to also investigate how to raise that chance from almost 0 to over 50%, by our abilities to predict the initial variables?

let's make an experiment!

we can elaborate some sort of real coin toss to be played in an event, by dozens or hundreds thousands of people, many times over and over again, as to teach them, as intuitively as the coin flip, how to get always on the same side. and, the closer people get to doing it, the better their chances are of winning a prize!

and we can statistically measure how much that prize will be given the game being played and chances of getting it right, like in the coin toss, by using raw data and tests alone.

unlike a casino, though, our idea is to use that data to better understand the specific kind of "randomness" around the game being played. beyond statistics. beyond fantasy game players, which is considered a game of ability and not luck. so way beyond luck. and then use this understanding to paint a better picture of "randomness".

keep in mind that we call ["random"](/random) whatever is beyond our understanding of reality. and being able to see it with any kind of clarity is like exploring mars: we don't know what we can find there, but we certainly know it's the kind of thing that inspire generations! it depends on how well we can sell the idea, but the idea is real and present. not only that, it can indeed lead to innovations beyond our comprehension.

# caxanga check list

caxanga is originally a name from a game in a children song, with unknown origins. it's also the name of this prototype.

## practical
- flipping fair coins, 50%
- being able to flip it always 100% in one side
- perhaps dice can't ever become 100%, given our human ability
- what can be used instead of physical objects being thrown
- maximize random noise from the human
- with enough data, we are exploring "randomness" like we explore mars
- discover what's there, unpack the randomness of individual abilities to detect minute noise in ourselves

## technical
- full transparency
- using bitcoins
- 3rd parties for instant fiat conversion
- free playing, no earnings
- 2 buttons to try the idea, heads or tails
- starts as for profit, become nonprofit afterwards - or find investors / partners
