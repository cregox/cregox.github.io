TK ![mind vs brain]({{ page.image }})

how **random** [(wait! what's random? hint: it's much more than most people expect)](/random) is our mind? basically, it's as random as it's more **intelligent** [(wait again! what's intelligence?! hint: iq doesn't tell even half the story)](/intelligence) than the perceiver.

there's so much that can be said about [the brain (by all means, watch all videos here)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXtN19u-oGmv7rme9MVeAmrP0XjbTPYhv&disable_polymer=true)...

but now it's tremendous controversy time: how the mind might be connected to a [black hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KikdPbX7z8Q&list=PLXtN19u-oGmv7rme9MVeAmrP0XjbTPYhv).

_30 minutes in loop, just leave it playing while reading._

ah, the brain.

such a mistery to understand.

what else could be as "random", or unpredictable, as a single and conscious human brain?

blackholes. i'd argue.

we have little to no clue about what happens inside blackholes. even less so than what happens inside the brain.

TK: and what's the difference between brain and mind? and how's the mind (rather than the brain) connected to all this?

ok, indeed, it's a weak link.

gravity is also weak!

among the 4 quantum forces it's by far the weakest one. yet, it keeps the whole universe connected.

but wait! there's actually more random connections. just how random, though?

there's this little card game called "the mind". the only main strategy that can be devised from playing it is core to our social brain: timing.

the awesome [golden feather](/golden-feather) puzzle can better illustrate what kind of timing. or the incredible [fireflies from ncase (explorable explanations)](https://ncase.me/fireflies/). in short: synchronization.

or using **spoilers** for the mind game, if you've played it: true and consistent harmony can only ever be achieved by devising an internal clock. it's as simple as counting seconds.

so, yeah, the mind game actually says a lot about how our mind works and how easy it is to deceive it.

more connections?

what comes first? the brain, the mind or the spirit? is spirit and mind even different things? is a mindless brain what zombies are made of?

ok. this is already big enough as it is.

i guess there was no point to be reached.

[cheers](/fun)! :)
