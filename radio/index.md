for now, the options to hear songs i enjoy are just in other sites

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL28DE3A85A7D3FA81) is nice to have videos (d'oh)
- [last fm](https://www.last.fm/user/cawas) huge list. sadly, the player only works on desktop
- [Deezer](http://www.deezer.com/playlist/775944713) new one, being updated. great flow mode, much better than anything else! (other than the last fm)

beware each one is quite an eclectic selection... although it's mostly between just Portuguese and English.
