project in hiatus almost since its [launch](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/blob/76498bfeee42d1d458c1554bb00615254337eeff/index.html), [days](https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/tree/76498bfeee42d1d458c1554bb00615254337eeff) before [open.ai's](https://blog.openai.com/introducing-openai/) in Dec 2015 [#envy](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel-about-the-other-novel).
