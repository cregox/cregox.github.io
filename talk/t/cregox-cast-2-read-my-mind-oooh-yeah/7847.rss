&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;_try to figure out what&#39;s in my mind before clicking here to find out the answer!_&lt;/summary&gt;are you sure? [spoiler]yay, I found a cancerogenous papaya which tastes good![/spoiler]
&lt;/details&gt;

if you know me you should be able to guess it properly as [the right answer is one filled with 3 elements](https://www.quora.com/What-do-I-need-to-learn-in-order-to-research-artificial-intelligence/answer/Caue-Rego): **logic + art + philosophy**.

( still unsure of what&#39;s the best category for buffering this... since it&#39;s on &quot;help&quot;, the request is: come join us! )

now, continuing the discussion from [Starting a pod with this making of &amp;quot;cregox cast&amp;quot;](http://talk.cregox.com/t/starting-a-pod-with-this-making-of-cregox-cast/7843/2):

# read my mind

rules are simple. host brings up a topic, then write down something about it that other players will have to guess. each player will have a few minutes to give it a shot after a presentation and then the answer will be revealed. so it&#39;s basically a riddle in which each player takes turn to take a guess.

it will happen near the cast ending because we&#39;re not sure everyone will be online near the beginning. I&#39;ll always bring a subject for this game, so we&#39;ll talk [about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage_(video_game)) [PASSAGE](http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/) (play it at least twice, [online](http://passage.toolness.org/) if you prefer).

be our guest to bring up a subject for other players trying to read what&#39;s in your mind! ;)

## schedule and plans for the future

as the first cast, this one will happen on a Saturday (**today**) at 22:00 UTC, which means I&#39;ll start broadcasting in about 5 hours. all the next ones, in case this one also brings a good result, might get moved to Sundays, at 20 UTC.

let&#39;s do this!
