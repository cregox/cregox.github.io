Hi Cauê Rego
we need some interactive magic. Enclosed is the example of the what we need. 
It&#39;s a Code Builder that we&#39;re after. We were thinking dropdowns, but also something more graphical would be good too.
This website will be done in Squarespace, so integration with the CSS would be great.
Let me know what you would charge to get both Modux One/Two/Four Configurator and Modux Micro Configurator live and able to send codes via email back to a user.
Looking forward to your reply.
Regards,

              <p>I understand you might have gotten a different expectation at first. This is, after all, a <em>new</em> business. I did change the plan right when you asked for a quote. Sorry about that, but that's what I've got to do.</p>

<p>You may be right, I may take much less, although I highly doubt it would be less than 16 hours.</p>

<p>In any case you can pay what you want, I'll give my best to deliver it in that time frame. If you're not happy, there is the refund. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"></p>

              <p>Hi Cawas,
let's talk about the most cost efficient method please. </p>

<p>Can you break that down please.
I was thinking that a series of dropdowns based on a set of Javascript list arrays would give us the front end. Of course it would be nicer to do something closer to a box-click selection, like the visual I provided.
I like the idea of a link to a new Squarespace page. Can you price up the 2 front end options with a link output please.
I'm sure that it's not 5 days to do that?
Look forward to your response. </p>

              <p>Thanks for the reply, good to know all that info. That's a lot of new stuff to build.</p>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> I'm not sure there is any way to send attachments with squarespace. We'd probably need to go to a 3rd party for that. <strong>But</strong> sending in email attachments were never a good practice to begin with. I recommend just skipping this plan.</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Rather, we could send a link to a squarespace page, which could be built by the code. Something like <code>example.com/code?m4-s-r-c-74-ww-r</code>. That alone would cost at least 1 day, depending still on more variables.</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> I could make a script to a form which can build an email with all this info needed and send it to the customer. The email will be very limited and basically just text. The form, at other hand, could look just like on that image, and be very nice and responsive. That also would take me at least 1 day.</p>

<p>So I've came up with this new price table ( do read <a href="http://www.cregox.com/your-home">www.cregox.com/your-home</a> ) because the old one wasn't cutting off <small>(<a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/the-making-of-your-home/7491/5?u=cawas">again</a>)</small>.</p>

<p>It will basically be U$984 per day. I think this might take up to 5 days, but that's just a guess.</p>

<p>The more you pay upfront, the faster the transactions and easier to work on it for consecutive days. If it takes me less time, I refund you for every U$123 per hour. If you're <strong>not happy</strong> with it, <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/pagination-for-shop-page-and-pages-width/7581/53?u=cawas">I can even give you a</a> <strong>full refund guaranteed</strong>. I'm really only trying to come up with a working business model here... <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="64" height="64"></p>

<p><strong>Not yet.</strong></p>

<p>What do you mean by "code builder"?</p>

<p><strong>There are 2 products that are composed of modular elements and finishes. Each of these attributes has a part code that when combined form a finished product code. For example:</strong> <br><strong>M4-S-R-C-74-WW-R is an example of a finished product code. See image enclosed.</strong></p>

<p>Could the data collected just go to your email or a spreadsheet?</p>

<p><strong>Email is preferred</strong></p>

<p>Please give an instance of what kind of "code" you envision the user would receive back. Can you make it into an image?</p>

<p><strong>M4-S-R-C-74-WW-R is an example of a finished product code.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It is envisaged that the finished code will have an associated image included in the email for visual confirmation.</strong></p>

<p>From there I'll see if I have enough data to give you a proper quote.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>
