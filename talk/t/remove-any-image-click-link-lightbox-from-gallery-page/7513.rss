Subject: Custom coding assistance with a Squarespace site required, please

Message: Caue,

As you can see from this email&#39;s subject I&#39;m in need of some custom CSS
support and here&#39;s hoping you will be able to come to my aid.

I have chosen the Wexley template for my Squarespace site and there&#39;s a
couple of changes I would like to make on this template however I don&#39;t
have ANY coding experience whatsoever. I&#39;ve asked the following question on
the Squarespace Answers forum with no luck so far and I&#39;m amazed that no
one their can support me with this because I don&#39;t feel that this one
change presents itself as a worthy challenge for someone to resolve with
CSS knowledge.

Anyway, here&#39;s the one question:

How do I disable the lightbox slideshow feature in the Wexley template&#39;s
gallery grid with custom CSS?

In other words one would NOT be able to click on any image (b/w teen
photos) in the gallery grid (to open a lightbox slideshow) I want the
images on the home page&#39;s gallery to display as is in the grid only without
them being clickable – I want the images to display-only WITHOUT the
clickthrough to the lightbox.

My site&#39;s URL (which is still a work-in-progress): helpingbrands.care

On the forum I was able to find some code suggestions similar to my
predicament which I had to customise somewhat to fit my site however with
no coding knowledge, no luck was on the horizon. Have a look at:

http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/70489/remove-the-gallery-links-in-a-summary-block

And:

http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/35218/disable-grid-views-lightbox

Anyway, here&#39;s hoping you can help me.

With optimism.
Tjaart L.

PS. There could be more custom CSS I might require with this site and I
have no problem remunerating you for your time.

              <p>You should try it then.</p>

<p>For any code you try, worst case that can happen is you add the code, something gets broken, you remove the code. Probably nothing will happen, though. As for the code in this page, I can guarantee you it can <strong>not</strong> break anything.</p>

<p>But, from what I can see, I don't think it will work without customizing it for your page indeed. Here's my shot at it:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">div.summary-block-collection-type-gallery div.summary-item-list div.summary-item {
  cursor: default;
  pointer-events: none;
}</code></pre>

<p>You see, finding out that specific set of CSS rules, the selectors, for your page, is just about learning how to use the very basic things of Inspector, in (almost) any desktop browser.</p>

<p>Here's a how to for that, which I found on first hit from google <code>inspector how to find css selector</code>:</p>

<p>Usually codes need to be tailored a lot and if just copying it from here didn't work, there's a chance that's the case.</p>

<p>Another thing that could have gone wrong is if you haven't added it to a right place. There are few places you could add it without anything extra, such as <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/using-the-css-editor">Custom CSS</a> and a <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/using-the-code-block#toc-add-html-code-to-display-content">Code Block (if you change the display content to CSS)</a>.</p>

<p>It will be easier to analyze if you post a link to your website.</p>

Similar to the initial request, I'm just looking to turn off the links entirely from the lightbox/gallery page - so users wouldn't be able to click on the image or text.

<p>Which basically confirms your second link's idea. I don't like how he solved it using collection ID though, that doesn't seem right.</p>

<p>Then use Inspector to find where's the click event on your page. Can't really teach this in a few lines, although I could have gone finding a link for you about it (short time right now).</p>

<p>Finally make a very specific CSS to it, and there's no need of <code>!important</code>:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">body.collection-type-gallery section#page div.thumb-list span.thumb {
  cursor: default;
  pointer-events: none;
}</code></pre>
