i'd like to begin with the best vsauce video here, but i already used it [elsewhere in this site](/random).

so, instead, let's start with what could be a tremendous controversy: how the mind is connected to a [black hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KikdPbX7z8Q&list=PLXtN19u-oGmv7rme9MVeAmrP0XjbTPYhv&index=27&t=246s). that is, outside my [brain playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXtN19u-oGmv7rme9MVeAmrP0XjbTPYhv&disable_polymer=true).

it's 30 minutes in loop. you can leave it playing, if you will, while reading.

ah, the brain.

such a mistery to understand. perhaps the biggest of them all. what else might compete, in our current understanding of reality?

blackholes. i'd argue.

there's no single structure nearly as complex as the brain... as far as we know what things are made of. but we have little to no clue about blackholes.

that's it. the whole connection i'd like to make between them, today.

but wait, there's actually more [random](/random) connections!

there's this little card game called "the mind". i won't link it here because i couldn't find a nice one. but the only main strategy that can be devised from playing it is core to our social brain. timing.

the awesome [golden feather]() puzzle can better illustrate what kind of timing. or the incredible [fireflies from ncase (explorable explanations)](https://ncase.me/fireflies/). in short: synchronization.

in other words, with spoilers for the mind game,
>! synchronization can be much improved by counting seconds.

there.

and, what comes first? the brain, the mind or the spirit? is spirit and mind even different things?

more TK...
