i thought to begin with the best vsauce video here, about [random](/random). because, within reason, it says a lot about our mind.

but perhaps it's better to start with what could be a tremendous controversy: how the mind is connected to a [black hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KikdPbX7z8Q&list=PLXtN19u-oGmv7rme9MVeAmrP0XjbTPYhv). that is, outside my [brain playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXtN19u-oGmv7rme9MVeAmrP0XjbTPYhv&disable_polymer=true).

_30 minutes in loop, just leave it playing while reading._

ah, the brain.

such a mistery to understand. might be the biggest of them all. what else might compete, in our current understanding of reality?

blackholes. i'd argue.

there's no single structure nearly as complex as the brain... as far as we know about what things are made of.

also, we have little to no clue about blackholes.

that's it.

indeed, it's a weak link. and so is gravity, among the 4 quantum forces it's by far the weakest one. yet, it keeps the whole universe connected.

but wait! there's actually more apparently random connections.

there's this little card game called "the mind". i won't link it here because i couldn't find a nice one. but the only main strategy that can be devised from playing it is core to our social brain. timing.

the awesome [golden feather](/golden-feather) puzzle can better illustrate what kind of timing. or the incredible [fireflies from ncase (explorable explanations)](https://ncase.me/fireflies/). in short: synchronization.

or using **spoilers** for the mind game, if you've played it: true and consistent harmony can only ever be achieved devising an internal clock. it's as simple as counting seconds.

so, yeah, the mind game actually says a lot about how our mind works and how easy it is to deceive it.

more connections?

what comes first? the brain, the mind or the spirit? is spirit and mind even different things? is a mindless brain what zombies are made of?

ok. this is already big enough as it is.

i guess there was no point to be reached.

for now, let's just agree the brain is freaking complex, shall we?

[cheers](/fun)! :)
