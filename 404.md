# 404 - "TOILET" (page) NOT FOUND

dumb jokes aside... if you're looking for "#jesus":

- try [sitemap](/sitemap)

- ask [jesus](/?q=#jesus)

- look [upstairs](http://images.google.com/images?q=url+bar)

- suggest [a new page](/newpage?a=#jesus)!

![jesus toilet pointers](/escher 4chan jesus.jpeg)
<sup>*gotta love escher and 4chan! ^_^*</sup>

in other words, we couldn't find the page you were looking for. this is probably because:

- there is an error in the URL [entered into your web browser](http://images.google.com/images?q=url+bar). please check the URL and try again. also [you may try](http://b.cregox.com/[jesus]) with _**b**.cregox.com_ (usually in place of **www**), to test your luck.

- the page you are looking for could have moved away, got deleted and/or forgotten. sorry. there's still hope, though!

you can try searching for the content you are seeking by "[asking jesus](/?q=#jesus)". you can also go to our [sitemap](/sitemap).

<script>
    document.querySelectorAll('a[href*="#jesus"]').forEach(function(item){
        item.href = item.href.replace('#jesus', window.location.pathname.slice(1))
    })
    item = document.body
    item.innerHTML = item.innerHTML.replace('#jesus', window.location.pathname.slice(1))
</script>
