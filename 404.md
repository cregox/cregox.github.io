dumb jokes aside... if you're looking for "#jesus":

- try [sitemap](/sitemap)

- ask [jesus]({{ page.ask }})

- look [upstairs]({{ page.upstairs }})

- suggest [a new page]({{ page.new }})!

<sup>*gotta love escher and 4chan! ^_^*</sup>

in other words, we couldn't find the page you were looking for. this is probably because:

- there is an error in the URL [entered into your web browser]({{ page.upstairs }}). please check the URL and try again.

- the page you are looking for moved away, got deleted and/or forgotten. sorry. there's still hope, though!

    })
    item = document.body
    item.innerHTML = item.innerHTML.replace('#jesus', window.location.pathname.slice(1))
