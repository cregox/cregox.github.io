![that boomerang ain't gonna fly itself!]({{ page.image }})

born "caue rego" (plus more names) and turned into web "cregox", i'm just a [random](/random) dude (who loves boomerangs!).

<small>unlike my [projects](/projects), including the ones i'm [proud](/proud), this is a (still non extensive) list that should be at least _somewhat_ useful to you and anyone, right now. even if only for you to have some [fun](/fun)!</small>

<small>it might be interesting to notice how most items intersect with the other lists, but in here they are offered with descriptions under your perspective, my dear visitor.</small>

- [feeling nostalgic? pcsedados](/pcsedados) we made back in 2003 and it's still in use today. cool little story but, above all, has pictures from an old age internet.
- [abaixa tampa (lower the toilet lid)]({{ site.a.abaixatampa }}) if you know me, perhaps you never knew i've got brad pitt jolie acting skills! co-wrote and co-stared in this play, as a bailarina tramp. here are the [photos]({{ site.a.caue.abaixatampa }}) to _prove_.
- [just a regular damme day]({{ site.a.damme }}) is my "before fame" video (before first acting lessons or anything related to plays, really). so, it should be specially fun for you to watch if you've met me before. i hope.
- [formigas](/formigas) was my adaptation from atari game. more nostalgia? are you a kind of a gamer person? if you also like to code, this is for you! else, you might want to skip it.
- [some photos](/caue-casting) for [casting](/casting), lol. if you enjoy feeling ashamed for other people.
- [homemade]({{ site.a.youtube }}) [videos](/videos) are 2 links where you can find more shameless trash i've recorded in motion.
- [i advise against building resumes](/resume). this one was even fun to create and maintain, but never gave me anything. because resumes don't bring work! networking and profiles meant to [help](/thanks) others, do.
- [ahoxus](/ahoxus) is my newest thing (may 2019). it's a morphing project about life, still looking for its shape.
