lucky number, between 0 and [<max>infinity</max>](javascript:max): 

# [<lucky>-1</lucky>](javascript:start())

[go to a new random page](https://www.google.com/doodles), provided by google and "magic"! or...

click on the number to get a new one.

seeing just a negative one? perhaps [we'll need permissions](javascript:start())...

what is [**true** random](//random.org)?

it's basically [the source of everything](/talk/t/true-randomness-app-why-it-could-help-winning-the-lottery-and-building-up-the-basiux/7845)!

computers can't generate those without help from the real world.

this page can help.

and for that, we need [access to the camera and microphone](javascript:start()).

nothing will be recorded. remember, the source code is completely open.

why?

not only this offers better chances of getting winning lottery numbers...

a true random number culture can change the world! TK
