<small>looking for the first [cregox/random](/lucky)?</small>

[what is random?](http://cregox.net/talk/t/differences-between-free-will-randomness-and-or-determinism/7804.html)

i tried to blog about it many times, as you may be able to read from that link.

now i don't do blog anymore. among many reasons, also because it has no versioning. no [true backup](/backup).

i do these manifestos now, instead. eventually, as usual. [chaotically, if you will](/ahoxus).

perhaps [vsauce brought the best explanation of randomness ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&list=PLXtN19u-oGmv7rme9MVeAmrP0XjbTPYhv&index=8&t=0s).

it's no coincidence he ends the video talking about "god".

randomness is basically patterns we can't recognize. in other words, a sort of intelligence bigger than ours.

because once we become smart enough (and this happens every second both for the individual and the collective) we learn more about new patterns that were unrecognizable before.

with that in mind, let us hail [a flying spaghetti monster](https://www.venganza.org/). or whatever.
