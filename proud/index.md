although i've worked writing code for most of my career, what i'm most proud of have very little to do with computers (mostly from the magical/sabbatical [2014](/2014)!):

- [your home](/your-home) was an accidental bootstrap i've created and discontinued during 6 months starting october 2014. 10% of it was about coding, the rest was divided among marketing, support and managing the business.
- [pcsedados](/pcsedados) service order system made in 2003 for about 2 months, still in use today. granted, most of it was coding, but the things i'm satisfied about it are basically the logic behind it and its longetivity.
- [abaixa tampa (lower the toilet lid)](//abaixatampa.wordpress.com/), a theater play in portuguese made in 3 months starting july 2014. i've co-wrote and co-stared in it, being one of the most proeminent actor in both ends, on my very first professional-ish experience in front of an audience. got lots of and only nice feedback from it.
- [just a regular damme day](//youtu.be/fxMaeJjY4jk), "cool" [video](/video) made in about 5 days from march 2014, in a basketball court. first and only video i'm glad to have done, so far...

now, i do have worthy coding projects, which were fun to build (and that's about it):

- **this very site** is all open *source*d, with the simple yet powerful jekyll and github.
- [basiux](/basiux) contains a small neat javascript Ai I've ported from another language in about 3 days from december 2015.
- [formigas](/formigas), another tiny game in MIT's Scratch made in about 5 days from january 2014.
- [trefnoc](/trefnoc) is a (now disfunct) python script to convert videos in a background queue from may 2010.
- [luckyshit](/luckyshit), very tiny game in [Unity3D](//answers.unity3d.com/users/822/cawas.html) made in about 10 hours guess when? september 2014.
- [StackOverflow](//stackoverflow.com/story/cauerego) and [GitHub](//github.com/cauerego) profiles.

and here are completely unimpressive projects:

- [ahoxus](/ahoxus) started around april 2018, got some traction and is slowly being built (updated january 2019).
- [some photos](//b.cregox.com/caue-casting) for [casting](/casting), lol.
- [homemade](//www.youtube.com/c/CaueRego) [videos](/videos) with 2 separate links!
