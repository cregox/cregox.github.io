although i've worked writing code for most of my career, the projects i'm most proud of have very little to do with coding:

- [your home](/your-home) was an accidental bootstrap i've created and discontinued during 6 months. 10% of it was about coding, the rest was divided among marketing, support and managing the business.
- [pcsedados](/pcsedados) service order system made in 2003 for about 2 months, still in use today. granted, most of it was coding, but the things i'm proud about it aren't the code...
- [Abaixa Tampa (Lower the toilet lid)](http://abaixatampa.wordpress.com/), a theater play in portuguese made in 3 months. i've co-wrote and co-stared in it, being one of the most proeminent actor in both ends, on my very first professional-ish experience in front of an audience. and i had only nice feedback from it.
- [Funny or Die with Jean Claude Van Damme and Guz](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/f6f674e14c/just-a-regular-damme-day), "cool" video made in about 5 days, in a basketball court. first one, not the last, but the only one lasting so far.

now, i do have many more worthy coding projects, which were fun to build, but never really went far beyond that to me:

- **this site** is all open *source*d, simplistic yet powerful (although overlooked) and shall be appreciated one day
- [basiux](http://basiux.org) contains a small neat javascript Ai I've ported from another language in about 3 days
- [formigas](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17273607/#player), another tiny game in MIT's Scratch made in about 5 days
- [trefnoc](/trefnoc) is a (now disfunct) python script to convert videos in a background queue
- [luckyshit](/luckyshit), very tiny game in [Unity3D](http://answers.unity3d.com/users/822/cawas.html) made in about 10 hours
- [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/story/cauerego) and [GitHub](https://github.com/cauerego) profiles

and i do have projects i'm not so proud of, such as:

- [Some photos for casting](https://b.cregox.com/caue-casting)
