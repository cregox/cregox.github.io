> why unverified? because i'd sure enjoy to be verified, but not in the way it's currently being done.

# preface

this is basically a blog post about a blog and a post! so meta... :D

ok...

many [blog](/blog) links are broken in this site. this page is about yet another one...

once upon a time, this link http://cregox.com/blog/2014/10/5/twitter-verified used to exist.

now it doesn't. but it was migrated and poorly archived into [http://cregox.net/talk/t/twitter-verified/3479.html](http://cregox.net/talk/t/twitter-verified/3479.html).

below there's mostly a copy of that same blog post. but i re-read it and edited it with my current knowledge of english. keep in mind i wrote it in 2014. and you can see every edit history in this site pretty much like in wikipedia, but more resourceful. thanks to git.

also, i'm editing it below because i want to keep this as my landing page from twitter... and, for such, i'd want to at least update the broken images from the damaged archive! as an added benefit, i get a better url. and updated ideas.

it was fun reading such things from my 4-years-ago-self and editing them. sometimes i can't understand anything i wrote even last week, but i guess i've been improving and that haven't happened so much recently. :)

on a side note... posting this blog post from 2014 (below) brought to my attention i haven't commented anywhere that pages on this site still show no modification or creation date. you can still figure them out by looking at the source if you will. sorry that's the only way, at least until we implement [some kind](http://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/trying-to-include-date-page-updated/1290/2) of auto date generation on jekyll... which may never happen! ;P

cheers.

## twitter verified

while searching google for "why does twitter verify accounts" i found [this interesting piece by William Shatner](http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/william-shatner-twitter-verified/).

_(disclaimer: please, keep in mind that while I appreciate sarcasm, i try to avoid it at all costs when writing "in public". i write in a very peculiar way and often people might think i'm being sarcastic. i'm not.)_

![some-lost-image-which-i-sadly-may-never-recover!](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/537cf764e4b02cb9fe050f36/t/5431aecfe4b002112adab0e1/1412542167373/?format=500w)

"verified" to me should mean one thing only: twitter somehow approves such person is who they claim to be. that's all.

and that could be done in a much smarter way, by letting the community regulate itself.

i was hoping that was what i'd read on mashable, due to its title. instead, i saw a tech-savvy old man talking how he would like "verified" to work. and i think it's all very reasonable... but not tech-savvy enough.

what does he want from it? does he just want it to be a "people i know" filter to his twitter home? or does he want someone to curate "very interesting smart people" for serendipity? a mix of both, or something else? i just know he is being at least a bit too much of a crybaby, imho. ok, i'm an assumed nobody, who cares, right? ;P

well, i do.

i want to be verified by a good community system, not by this flawed twitter one. i want to be famous and considered "interesting" by Shatner, and lots of other folks (a couple of other cool old hags that comes to mind are Dvorak and Laporte, from twit before twitter)...

but i don't really care that much. they won't help me pay my bills. and since I couldn't care less about PR, twitter, facebook, and so many other social media thingies, i probably will never be officially verified.

and i definitely don't want to make a lifestyle out of popularity. never did. i don't know what i do want from life. i find it easier to live day by day and discover things i **don't** want. then, eventually, avoid 'em or change my taste.

all that said, having my own niche of fans, or clients, or something from which i could survive doing something i love wouldn't hurt! =)

i may never be polite enough even for that, though. or optimistic enough. who knows what choices we make can lead us to where we envision ourselves today? i believe that the future is set in hard stone and we can only learn how to enjoy the ride (check my other blog post for more on that).

_proudly unverified_

anyway... in fact, i just decided to hack my way in this "verified" twitter bullshit. take a look at my new profile image on the side.

reason i'm posting this? because i felt like answering him, and maybe he'd read and engage in some kind of healthy discussion. that would be wicked cool! in fact, i'd enjoy talking about this with anyone with similar views from him. or anyone willing to engage, really. i'm desperate! (ok, I like to think this was sarcasm)

reason i was googling? i couldn't understand why twitter verification was so flawed. now i think i do. or at least i felt i didn't have to google any further. thanks, mr shatner! ;)
