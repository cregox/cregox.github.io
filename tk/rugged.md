first, yeah, i don't keep dropping laptops to test them irl. but i did drop my rugged asus many times and it did last solid. plus, i did use it on construction sites, with dust, and it was once again solid. that test forgets this aspect. plus it's still cheaper... not to mention Google warranty sucks balls globally, Google store is completely evil and Samsung isrugged.md
