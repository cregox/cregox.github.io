# how my $999 loss to pixel 3 google fi stupid promo might teach you something about their store

this is an unfinished story, although i mostly have up on it by now, November 2019. i just hope that this might help and better inform people about google store true current position: of an evil sales store.

now...

# preface

if you have experience dealing with those ill-intended salespeople or companies, you'll find nothing new here.

and if you're skeptical about the veracity of my facts, please, feel free to check them. here are 5 pdfs with some relevant email conversations i had with them and which should prove i'm right. yes, they just ignored them. multiple times.

so, my ultimate advice to anyone when purchasing with google is: **don't be naive** like me. google is, sadly, just another big company/store trying their best to make their big bucks and fuck anyone in the process. "don't be evil" was probably never their motto, just a marketing campaign.

perhaps google was just not ready to get into the consumer world, and it's [doing a terrible job](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/04/19/passive-aggressive-level-9000-instead-of-a-refund-google-sent-someone-10-pink-pixel-3s/) at it while trying to improve. i'll only believe this, though, if they come around before i can resolve my situation in some other way.

# the story

i'll be short. let me know if you want more details.

on the promo day i went through their policy. and it was unclear if i could use it in my situation. i live in portugal, and i wanted the phone for myself. my mom lives in NH, and she could use google fi. regardless, we wouldn't move towards either thing if not thanks to the amazing promo. so i called them. multiple times. and we got to an agreement. it's on paper.

the agreement was that we both thought my situation was good enough and i could benefit from the promo, if only the google fi stayed active during the whole 90 days.

guess what? i fulfilled my part.

got no credit.

called them.

first time, they say "you didn't buy on date".

i gave them proof i did.

second time they say "you swapped devices".

yes, i did. by mistake. my mom did, actually. so what? it wasn't on our agreement. and it wasn't on the unclear policy. they interpreted as they wished later on, to basically fulfill this fraud on other people, and they thought internally this was a good enough excuse for my case as well.

turns out, it isn't. not for me. not for anyone who look at the whole picture, i'm arguing.

but i'm still out of luck trying to find a decent person in their actually terrible "support" "team".

# now what?

so i gave up trying - also because, well, life is happens.

i foresaw trouble kilometers, or megameters away. and i thought i was prepared. but i wasn't. not for all other things that came with life, coincidentally. i couldn't follow up.

so now i'll privacy just take the hit and sell this piece of junk for cheap. because nobody ever really liked pixel 3 after the 3a, it instantly had its price dropped. for sure Google foresaw it coming. i just don't know why they wanted me to pay for their bullshit...

this, right here, is both my attempt to get some media attention, of course, and warn other people the best i can: beware of google and its store. especially the promos and sales "support" promises (d'oh).

cheers!
