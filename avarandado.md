our house for 1 year, until the 2019 summer, which we enjoyed for amazing 3 weeks. for the rest of the summer, i was mostly making a [story](/story). it might look unrelated, but it's all part of my long life quest for a home. which is of course inside me, but in reality it also needs much more materialism.
