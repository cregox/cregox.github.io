picture a crayon. the crayon.

and then there was light! and darkness… oops, light again, but a teal colour. what the actual fuck?

(try picturing every scene transition as a cut-less flow. and a crayon almost everywhere)

a teal crayon.

it is removed from the pack, by a kid.

she draws two circles.

the sun shines over the earth.

a spiderman drawing in a computer. and superman.

the grown up unnamed kid is now playing world of warcraft. a computer game, played online by thousands of people at the same time, fighting mostly against computer medieval magical monsters.

beside another virgin grown up. both silently.

the power goes off. all is dark. someone screams an uptight “shit”. there’s silence. and laughter.

the laugh turns into a hospital siren.

red crayon.

surgeries are taking place in One. in the eyes. a simple genital cosmetic. something on a butt.

a fart. turns into shit. garbage. compost. a common recycling cycle in an ecovillage.

a baby is born. and another one.

pink and blue crayons.

a couple having sex. One’s on top. they’re both fully enjoying it. however he cums outside. she’s relieved. he’s exhausted. or was it the other way around? TK
