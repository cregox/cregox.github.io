# {{ page.description }}

- the "tv" is currently on [google drive]({{page.drive}}).

[neverthink.tv](https://neverthink.tv/code) is not quite as [random](/random) as i'd wish, but that's almost the whole idea right there... although [tiktok](https://tiktok.com/@cregox) would be a much better UX in general: just one big "random channel". jump into similar things as you wish. etc.

at some point in 2015 i thought it would be fun to try making something like [9gag tv](http://9gag.com/tv) or [iflscience](http://www.iflscience.com/team/elise-andrew/) (or even curiosity.com in 2019, which is sadly dead now). later on i found out about something [similar](https://www.patreon.com/lolhehehe) to my will, except i have no wish to produce anything in non-english.

i ended up creating a "fas tv" google plus collection:

> curated [f]un, [a]wesome and [s]cience items from the web. content that could show in an **adult** TV. only our very favourite ones.

well, it never worked. and google plus is now dead.

still, i actually got [**plenty related files**]({{page.drive}}) i wish to share in a more interesting fashion (and probably not everything from there).

more than just about sharing links, it should also prevent them from breaking. [me hates that](/backup). :(

tl;dr;

fas tv is no more. for now!

i know you'd love me to do something about it... we'll see.
