"what's [ahoxus](/ahoxus)?" one might ask.

it's a project about improving life. it goes through a farm, an eco village, a community, a tribe.

it's a group of people who want to live to their fullest potential, in a public manner, as a political statements and leadership. an example and a path of teaching and learning.

with love.

and this page is a draft. [TK](/tk)

from the title to the video, i'm not sure what form it'll take. for now, it's mostly a place holder for the video i promised to share with [CO project farm](https://www.coproject.co/volunteer)

please, enjoy!
