i've wrote too much about backup. a lot of times.

it always ends up being about how i was trying to [keep some of my data to myself](https://medium.cregox.com/how-to-keep-all-your-data-to-yourself-930ac30cae7d).

one of the big beauties of computers is how they turn copying data into an easy task.

make it simple to generate **redundancy** and avoid losing *important* data.

**the internet was made as a backup/redundancy plataform, folks!** - let's honor that, shall we?

now... what data is *important*?

trying to answer that is like trying to predict the future.

i want to keep all my data, or as much as possible (specially textual and such small data points).

i need to. for [sanity (funny enough, tried using my backups to find this link and 2 failed due to searching issues*)]().

can we trust ourselves to always do it manually?

true backup needs to be automatic, ffs. computers are also much more reliable.

problem is, even today, that's still a freaking difficult quest. lost lots of data on the way. :(

because most "engineers" forget that internet redundancy principle. myself included. it's in our culture to forget it.

anyway...

a bit more in practice, computer wise, in the past i've used a combination of 1 local backup and 2 different clouds. now i'm with just 1 cloud, and fearing for the life of my data. plus never managed to properly automate videos and most web content. still, i do manually download them and do automate part of it, thanks to a few awesome online services.

guess we'll have to _keep on trying_...

* or perhaps i should stop worrying so much about it and keep on the one and only ultimate backup: chao..[.]() i mean, [gratitude](https://curiosity.com/topics/see-how-your-gratitude-stacks-up-with-this-gratitude-survey-curiosity/).

_[should we](/contact) be using less gif's?_

PS: to be more specific...

- the local backup was apple's time machine. the mac would also have a dropbox folder synced into google drive.
- now, with chromebook, time machine and dropbox are gone, as backup tools. but dropbox was never a reliable one to begin with, and time machine, well, i forgot its password (not to mention it's also quite unreliable, being a single physical disk and all). even while using 2 password managers. because none of them reminds me of saving a disk encryption key. privacy getting in the way of security, once again!
- the 2 backups that failed to find data i was looking for were hangouts and getpocket. i know the data is there, i could find it in one of them later, but the SEARCH failed to find it. completely frustrating. thankfuly, google helped. with the right keywords. and only because the old link wasn't broken (yet), of course. old internet links are bound to be broken faster than my memory of them. mostly. even with the web archives. plural. fundamentaly stupid ideas based on the bigger stupidity of flawed internet protocols that don't include personal backups as the one i envision here.
- google in general, its "tracking", gmail (i do forward them all to a backup gmail), getpocket and ifttt are my main web content true backup tools. everything else is manual, including freaking google takeout and, in a way, drive.
